abstract = {Piranhas and their relatives have proven to be a challenging group from a systematic perspective, with difficulties in identification of species, linking of juveniles to adults, diagnosis of genera, and recognition of higher-level clades. In this study we add new molecular data consisting of three mitochondrial regions for museum vouchered and photo-documented representatives of the Serrasalmidae. These are combined with existing serrasalmid sequences in GenBank to address species and higher-level questions within the piranhas using parsimony and Bayesian methods. We found robust support for the monophyly of Serrasalmus manueli, but not for Serrasalmus gouldingi when GenBank specimens identified as S. gouldingi were included in the analysis. "Serrasalmus gouldingi" sequences in GenBank may, however, be misidentified. Linking of juveniles to adults of the same species was greatly facilitated by the addition of sequence data. Based on our sampling and identifications, our data robustly reject the monophyly of the genera Serrasalmus and Pristobrycon. We found evidence for a well-supported clade comprised of Serrasalmus, Pygocentrus, and Pristobrycon ( in part). This clade was robustly supported in separate and combined analyses of gene regions, and was also supported by a unique molecular character, the loss of a tandem repeat in the control region. Analysis of specimens and a literature review suggest this clade is also characterized by the presence of a pre-anal spine and ectopterygoid teeth. A persistent polytomy at the base of this clade was dated using an independent calibration as 1.8 million years old, corresponding to the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch, and suggesting an origin for this clade more recent than dates cited in the recent literature. The sister group to this clade is also robustly supported, and consists of Catoprion, Pygopristis, and Pristobrycon striolatus. If the term piranha is to refer to a monophyletic clade, it should be restricted to Serrasalmus, Pygocentrus, and Pristobrycon ( in part), or expanded to include these taxa plus Pygopristis, Catoprion, and Pristobrycon striolatus.},

abstract = {Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed the major role played by the uplift of the Andes in the extraordinary diversification of the Neotropical flora. These studies, however, have typically considered the Andean uplift as a single, time-limited event fostering the evolution of highland elements. This contrasts with geological reconstructions indicating that the uplift occurred in discrete periods from west to east and that it affected different regions at different times. We introduce an approach for integrating Andean tectonics with biogeographic reconstructions of Neotropical plants, using the coffee family (Rubiaceae) as a model group. The distribution of this family spans highland and montane habitats as well as tropical lowlands of Central and South America, thus offering a unique opportunity to study the influence of the Andean uplift on the entire Neotropical flora. Our results suggest that the Rubiaceae originated in the Paleotropics and used the boreotropical connection to reach South America. The biogeographic patterns found corroborate the existence of a long-lasting dispersal barrier between the Northern and Central Andes, the "Western Andean Portal." The uplift of the Eastern Cordillera ended this barrier, allowing dispersal of boreotropical lineages to the South, but gave rise to a huge wetland system ("Lake Pebas") in western Amazonia that prevented in situ speciation and floristic dispersal between the Andes and Amazonia for at least 6 million years. Here, we provide evidence of these events in plants.},

abstract = {Exceptionally high shelf-subsidence rates (0.8-6.0+mm/yr), a marked basinward stepping (to east and northeast) of the paleo-Orinoco shelf prism and post-Pliocene uplift of Trinidad all allow the sedimentary facies, process regime and the evolution of the Late Miocene Orinoco Delta to be evaluated from extensive outcrops along the southwest, and south coasts of Trinidad. The ca. 200km easterly growth (late Miocene to present) of the Orinoco shelf-margin was generated by repeated cross-shelf, regressive-transgressive transits of the Orinoco Delta system. The studied Late Pliocene segment of this shelf-margin prism allows insight to how this margin was built. The Morne L'Enfer Formation (Late Pliocene) along Cedros Bay and Erin Bay in SW Trinidad, provides a window into the facies and process regime of the ca. 850m-thick deltaic succession at an inner-shelf location some 100km landward of the coeval shelf edge. Regressive facies associations include tide-influenced delta-front to prodelta deposits (FA1) within upward coarsening units, shoreface to offshore deposits, possibly with prograding mud cape deposits (FA2), and fluvial distributary channel infills (FA3), as well as muddy sediments of floodbasins and coastal embayments between the distributary channels (FA4), and tide-influenced bay-head delta deposits (FA5). Transgressive facies associations show an overall upward fining of grain size and include inner estuary distributary channels with minimal brackish-water or tidal influence (FA6), transition zone fluvial-tidal distributary channels (FA7), tide-dominated mid-outer estuary channel-bars (FA8), and intertidal to supratidal flat units (FA9). The tidal signals in both deltaic and estuarine units include bi-directional paleocurrents (channels), frequent mud drapes within stacked sets of cross-strata (delta-front), fluid mud layers, flaser, wavy and lenticular bedding, and ubiquitous spring-neap stratal bundling. The tide dominated nature of the paleo-delta in SW Trinidad was likely due to its location within an embayed proto-Columbus Channel, though by analogy with the modern Orinoco Delta, it is predicted that the same succession becomes wave dominated to the east as the delta emerged to the open ocean and approached the outer shelf and shelf-edge region. It is difficult to estimate how much of the abundant mud in the Pliocene deltaic sequences was derived from inner-shelf littoral currents with suspended Amazon River mud. The studied Late Pliocene Morne L'Enfer succession contains some 17 high-frequency transgressive-regressive sequences, each ca. 40-60m thick, estimated to have an average time duration of 90-120Ky. By analogy, the last glacial cycle on the Orinoco shelf saw the delta prograding across the 200km-wide shelf to the shelf edge in ca. 100Ky, then transgressing back to its present position in 20Ky. A predicted model of the linkage between the study succession on SW Trinidad and its eastward continuation offshore towards the outer shelf and shelf edge in the Columbus Basin is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from Amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the Andes. This uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the Amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. On this “Andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in Western Amazonia. We show that Andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of Amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-Quaternary.},

abstract = {Integration of several geologic lines of evidence reveals the prevalence of a lowland trans-Andean portal communicating western Amazonia and the westernmost Andes from at least middle Miocene until Pliocene times. Volcanism and crustal shortening built up relief in the southernmost Central and Eastern Cordilleras of Colombia, closing this lowland gap. Independent lines of evidence consist first, of field mapping in the Tatacoa Desert with a coverage area of ∼381 km 2 , 1,165 km of geological contact traces, 164 structural data points, and 3D aerial digital mapping models. This map documents the beginning of southward propagation of the southernmost tip of the Eastern Cordillera's west-verging, fold-and-thrust belt between ∼12.2 and 13.7 Ma. Second, a compilation of new and published detrital zircon geochronology in middle Miocene strata of the Tatacoa Desert shows three distinctive age populations: middle Miocene, middle Eocene, and Jurassic; the first two sourced west of the Central Cordillera, the latter in the Magdalena Valley. Similar populations with the three distinctive peaks have now been recovered in western Amazonian middle Miocene strata. These observations, along with published molecular and fossil fish data, suggest that by Serravallian times (∼13 Ma), the Northern Andes were separated from the Central Andes at ∼3°N by a fluvial system that flowed into the Amazon Basin through the Tatacoa Desert. This paleogeographic configuration would be similar to a Western Andean, or Mara{\~{n}}on Portal. Late Miocene flattening of the subducting Nazca slab caused the eastward migration of the Miocene volcanic arc, so that starting at ∼4 Ma, large composite volcanoes were built up along the axis of today's Central Cordillera, closing this lowland Andean portal and altering the drainage patterns to resemble a modern configuration.},

abstract = {Montane areas in the Neotropics are characterized by high diversity and endemism of birds and other groups. The avian genus Myioborus (Parulinae) is a group of insectivorous warblers, characteristic of cloud forests, that represents one of the few Parulinae genera (New World warblers) that has radiated substantially in South America. The genus is distributed throughout most montane regions from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina. Here, I use mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3 genes to present the first hypothesis of phylogenetic relationship among all Myioborus species level taxa. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods produced similar results and suggest a northern origin for the genus Myioborus with subsequent colonization of the Neotropical Montane Region. The lower-montane species, M. miniatus, is the sister taxon to a clade in which all taxa occupy upper-montane habitats. These "highland" taxa diverged early in the history of the genus and produced two well-defined monophyletic lineages, a Central-northern Andean clade formed by M. albifrons, M. ornatus, and M. melanocephalus, and a Pantepui (table-mountains of southern Venezuela, northern Brazil, and western Guyana) clade consisting of M. castaneocapillus, M. albifacies, and M. cardonai, and probably M. pariae. M. brunniceps, M. flavivertex, and M. torquatus were included in this upper-montane clade but without clear relationships to other taxa. Lack of resolution of nodes defining the upper-montane species clade is likely to result from a period of rapid diversification mediated by geological and climatic events during the Late Pliocene. These results suggest that an interplay of dispersal and vicariance has shaped the current biogeographic patterns of Myioborus.},

abstract = {Far more species of organisms are found in the tropics than in temperate and polar regions, but the evolutionary and ecological causes of this pattern remain controversial 1,2 . Tropical marine fish communities are much more diverse than cold-water fish communities found at higher latitudes 3,4, and several explanations for this latitudinal diversity gradient propose that warm reef environments serve as evolutionary 'hotspots' for species formation 5-8 . Here we test the relationship between latitude, species richness and speciation rate across marine fishes. We assembled a time-calibrated phylogeny of all ray-finned fishes (31,526 tips, of which 11,638 had genetic data) and used this framework to describe the spatial dynamics of speciation in the marine realm. We show that the fastest rates of speciation occur in species-poor regions outside the tropics, and that high-latitude fish lineages form new species at much faster rates than their tropical counterparts. High rates of speciation occur in geographical regions that are characterized by low surface temperatures and high endemism. Our results reject a broad class of mechanisms under which the tropics serve as an evolutionary cradle for marine fish diversity and raise new questions about why the coldest oceans on Earth are present-day hotspots of species formation.},

@article{Brown2018,
abstract = {—Divergence time estimation—the calibration of a phylogeny to geological time—is an integral first step in modeling the tempo of biological evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms, where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al. (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of representative major lineages. These results demonstrate the impact of (potentially common) model violations. Here, we suggest another potential challenge: that the configuration of the statistical inference problem (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated priors) alone may preclude the reconstruction of the paleontological timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree (diversification) prior with the calibration densities specified for fossil-calibrated nodes) that with no data present at all, that an Early Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior and posterior age distributions when employing routine lognormal fossil calibration priors. These results indicate that there is inadequate information in the data to over-rule the joint prior. Given that these calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the tree, they act to anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the pseudodata present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and posterior distributions be carefully compared to determine whether signal is coming from the data or prior belief, especially for parameters of direct interest. This recommendation is not novel. However, given how rarely such checks are carried out in evolutionary biology, it bears repeating. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of prior/posterior comparisons in any Bayesian analysis, and we hope that they further encourage both researchers and journals to consistently adopt this crucial step as standard practice. Finally, we note that the results presented here do not refute the biological modeling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward more confidently. [marginal priors; information content; diptych; divergence time estimation; fossil record; BEAST; angiosperms.] " Molecular clocks are not up to the job, but neither is the fossil record. " Donoghue and Benton (2007) Divergence time estimation from molecular genetic sequences is fraught with uncertainty. The errors involved in routine phylogenetic reconstruction (suboptimal alignments, inadequate substitution models, insufficient taxon/gene sampling, real gene tree/species tree conflict, etc.) are compounded by assumptions required to transform a phylogram (in units of expected number of substitutions per site) into a chronogram (in units of geological time): (i) an appropriate model of substitution rate heterogeneity among lineages and across time, and (ii) temporal calibrations, generated from the fossil (or biogeographic) record, used to inform and constrain the extent of rate variation. It is therefore not surprising that there are discrepancies between inferred molecular genetic and paleontological timescales. However, while many},

abstract = {Aim Although hundreds of tree species have broad geographic ranges in the Neotropics, little is known about how such widespread species attained disjunct distributions around mountain, ocean and xeric barriers. Here, we examine the phylogeographic structure of a widespread and economically important tree, Cordia alliodora, to: (1) test the roles of vicariance and dispersal in establishing major range disjunctions, (2) determine which geographic regions and/or habitats contain the highest levels of genetic diversity, and (3) infer the geographic origin of the species. Location Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH–psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. Results Although the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH–psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choc{\'{o}} (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species. Dispersal is evident in the West Indies and the northern Andean cordilleras. The dry ecotype harbours genetic variation that is likely to represent the source for the establishment of populations under future warmer and drier climatic scenarios.},

abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

abstract = {Andean uplift contributed importantly to the build-up of high Neotropical diversity. Final uplift of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia separated once-contiguous lowland faunas east and west of the Andes between 5 and 3.5 million years ago (Ma hereafter). We used DNA sequences from several moderate- to fast-evolving mitochondrial and two slow-evolving nuclear genes to generate a well-supported phylogeny of Dendrocincla woodcreepers, a genus with multiple species endemic to lowland regions both east and west of the Andes. A time-calibrated phylogeny and dispersal-vicariance analysis indicated that uplift of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia resulted in the initial vicariant separation of a widespread lowland form east and west of the Andes at c. 3.6 Ma. This was followed by two separate east-to-west dispersal events over or around the completed Andes, each producing a genetically distinct lineage. Our analysis suggests that Andean uplift promoted the build-up of biodiversity in lowland Neotropical faunas both through vicariance-based speciation during uplift and through dispersal-based speciation following uplift. In contrast to the multiple colonizations of the trans-Andean region by Dendrocincla, the Atlantic Forest was colonized from the Amazon only once, followed by in situ diversification.},

abstract = {Numerous methods exist for estimating the true stratigraphic range of a fossil taxon based on the stratigraphic positions of its fossil occurrences. Many of these methods require the assumption of uniform fossil recovery potential-that fossils are equally likely to be found at any point within the taxon's true range. This assumption is unrealistic, because factors such as stratigraphic architecture, sampling effort, and the taxon's abundance and geographic range affect recovery potential. Other methods do not make this assumption, but they instead require a priori quantitative knowledge of recovery potential that may be difficult to obtain. We present a new Bayesian method, the Adaptive Beta method, for estimating the true stratigraphic range of a taxon that works for both uniform and non-uniform recovery potential. In contrast to existing methods, we explicitly estimate recovery potential from the positions of the occurrences themselves, so that a priori knowledge of recovery potential is not required. Using simulated datasets, we compare the performance of our method with existing methods. We show that the Adaptive Beta method performs well in that it achieves or nearly achieves nominal coverage probabilities and provides reasonable point estimates of the true extinction in a variety of situations. We demonstrate the method using a dataset of the Cambrian mollusc Anabarella.},

In NSA several genera are restricted to trans-Andean drainages (Figure 15.3), including Caquetaia, Ctenolucius, Crossoloricaria, Saccoderma, Gilbertolus, Ichthyoelephas, Cheirocerus, Doraops, Eremophilus, and Genycharax. Among the strictly trans-Andean genera several are endemic to the Magdalena Basin (Centrochir, Genycharax, Grundulus) or Maracaibo (Doraops, Perrunichthys).

In contrast, the Magdalena Basin with 256,622

abstract = {A review of fossils of extinct Bison from the Mojave Desert of California and Nevada demonstrates that the genus is even rarer in the region than was previously thought. The presence of fossils resembling Bison antiquus is confirmed only from the Las Vegas Valley, China Lake, Lake Manix (high in the section), and Dove Spring Wash. Additionally, a magnum of a very large Bison is present from a locality at Twentynine Palms. Other published records of Bison from the Mojave are problematic. Fossils assigned to Bison cf. B. antiquus from older (,290 Ka) sediments at Lake Manix are actually Camelops. A reported occurrence of Bison from the Pinto Basin is also Camelops. Fossils previously assigned to Bison sp. from the Piute Valley are an indeterminate large bovid and a large Equus. Bison is presently considered to have arrived in North America south of the ice between 210 6 60 Ka and approximately160 Ka. Radiometric dates for confirmed occurrences of the genus Bison in the Mojave Desert range from less than 144 to 15 Ka and possibly 11 Ka in the Las Vegas Valley to between approximately 35 and 19 Ka at Lake Manix, about 19 Ka at China Lake, and approximately 16 Ka at Dove Spring Wash. The observed date range accords well with the age of coastal and inland Southern California records of extinct Bison (e.g., Rancho La Brea, Diamond Valley Lake, etc.), which are also relatively young. Fossils of Bison in the Mojave Desert have no older dates. The observed distributions and ages of Bison in the Mojave Desert and the southwest suggest that the genus might have had a more restricted temporal range than previously thought. This has important implications for biostratigraphy, for regional paleoecological reconstructions, and for correct interpretations of megafaunal representation and diversity at the end of the Pleistocene.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent molecular hypotheses suggest that some traditional suprageneric taxa of Characiformes require revision, as they may not constitute monophyletic groups. This is the case for the Bryconidae. Various studies have proposed that this family (considered a subfamily by some authors) may be composed of different genera. However, until now, no phylogenetic study of all putative genera has been conducted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the present study, we analyzed 27 species (46 specimens) of all currently recognized genera of the Bryconidae (ingroup) and 208 species representing all other families and most genera of the Characiformes (outgroup). Five genes were sequenced: 16SrRNA, Cytochrome b, recombination activating gene 1 and 2 and myosin heavy chain 6 cardiac muscle. The final matrix contained 4699 bp and was analyzed by maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. The results show that the Bryconidae, composed of Brycon, Chilobrycon, Henochilus and Salminus, is monophyletic and is the sister group of Gasteropelecidae + Triportheidae. However, the genus Brycon is polyphyletic. Fossil studies suggest that the family originated approximately 47 million years ago (Ma) and that one of the two main lineages persisted only in trans-Andean rivers, including Central American rivers, suggesting a much older origin of Mesoamerican ichthyofauna than previously accepted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Bryconidae is composed by five main clades, including the genera Brycon, Chilobrycon, Henochilus and Salminus, but a taxonomic review of these groups is needed. Our results point to a possible ancient invasion of Central America, dating about 20.3 ± 5.0 Ma (late Oligocene--early Miocene), to explain the occurrence of Brycon in Central America.},

abstract = {Higher-level relationships among catfishes were investigated by parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of two nuclear genes across 110 catfish species representing 36 of 37 families and Conorhynchos (family incertae sedis). Analysis of 3660 aligned base pairs from the rag1 and rag2 genes confirms monophyly of Siluriformes, of most siluriform families and of a number of multifamily groups, some recognized, some novel. South American Loricarioidei are recovered as the sistergroup to other catfishes which are divided into Diplomystidae and Siluroidei. This result contrasts with the prevailing hypothesis that Diplomystidae is the sister to all other catfishes. Monophyly of Siluroidei is supported by rag data including a unique three-codon deletion from rag1. Deep within Siluroidei are 12 large, strongly supported groups with poorly resolved interrelationships. Five are single families: Cetopsidae, Plotosidae, Chacidae, Siluridae and Pangasiidae. Four others are monophyletic taxa ranked here as superfamilies: Clarioidea (Clariidae, Heteropneustidae), Arioidea (Ariidae, Anchariidae), Pimelodoidea (Pimelodidae, Pseudopimelodidae, Heptapteridae, Conorhynchos), Ictaluroidea (Ictaluridae, Cranoglanididae). South American Doradoidea (Doradidae, Auchenipteridae) and Aspredinidae are a sistergroup pair. Sisoroidea (without Aspredinidae), Ailia+Laides, Horabagridae, and Bagridae (without Rita) form a large, predominantly Asian clade, "Big Asia." Mochokidae, Malapteruridae, Amphiliidae, Claroteidae, and African schilbids are united as a species-rich African clade, "Big Africa." The three large continental clades, "Big Asia," "Big Africa" and Neotropical Loricarioidei suggest a prevalence of intracontinental diversification of catfishes. South America is the home of the Gymnotiformes, putative sistergroup of catfishes, plus two of the deepest siluriform clades, Loricarioidei and Diplomystidae, thus suggesting an ancient siluriform presence if not origin there. The rag phylogeny does not identify any African-South American catfish clade. The well-known African-Asian relationships within families Clariidae and Bagridae are confirmed, as is the recently found North American-Asian relationship between Ictaluridae and Cranoglanididae.},

abstract = {The temporal dynamics of species diversity are shaped by variations in the rates of speciation and extinction, and there is a long history of inferring these rates using first and last appearances of taxa in the fossil record. Understanding diversity dynamics critically depends on unbiased estimates of the unobserved times of speciation and extinction for all lineages, but the inference of these parameters is challenging due to the complex nature of the available data. Here, we present a new probabilistic framework to jointly estimate species-specific times of speciation and extinction and the rates of the underlying birth-death process based on the fossil record. The rates are allowed to vary through time independently of each other, and the probability of preservation and sampling is explicitly incorporated in the model to estimate the true lifespan of each lineage. We implement a Bayesian algorithm to assess the presence of rate shifts by exploring alternative diversification models. Tests on a range of simulated data sets reveal the accuracy and robustness of our approach against violations of the underlying assumptions and various degrees of data incompleteness. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method with the diversification of the mammal family Rhinocerotidae and reveal a complex history of repeated and independent temporal shifts of both speciation and extinction rates, leading to the expansion and subsequent decline of the group. The estimated parameters of the birth-death process implemented here are directly comparable with those obtained from dated molecular phylogenies. Thus, our model represents a step towards integrating phylogenetic and fossil information to infer macroevolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Species richness varies considerably among the tree of life which can only be explained by heterogeneous rates of diversification (speciation and extinction). Previous approaches use phylogenetic trees to estimate branch-specific diversification rates. However, all previous approaches disregard diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages although 99{\%} of species that ever existed are now extinct. Here we describe a lineage-specific birth-death-shift process where lineages, both extant and extinct, may have heterogeneous rates of diversification. To facilitate probability computation we discretize the base distribution on speciation and extinction rates into k rate categories. The fixed number of rate categories allows us to extend the theory of state-dependent speciation and extinction models (e.g., BiSSE and MuSSE) to compute the probability of an observed phylogeny given the set of speciation and extinction rates. To estimate branch-specific diversification rates, we develop two independent and theoretically equivalent approaches: numerical integration with stochastic character mapping and data-augmentation with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We validate the implementation of the two approaches in RevBayes using simulated data and an empirical example study of primates. In the empirical example, we show that estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are, unsurprisingly, very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. Instead, branch-specific diversification rate estimates are less sensitive to the assumed prior distribution on the number of diversification-rate shifts and consistently infer an increased rate of diversification for Old World Monkeys. Additionally, we observe that as few as 10 diversification-rate categories are sufficient to approximate a continuous base distribution on diversification rates. In conclusion, our implementation of the lineage-specific birth-death-shift model in RevBayes provides biologists with a method to estimate branch-specific diversification rates under a mathematically consistent model.},

abstract = {Abstract The characiform fishes of the Neotropics and Africa radiated remarkably in ecomorphology, but the macroevolutionary processes responsible for their biodiversity remain unexplored, and the degree to which their continental diversification parallels classic adaptive radiations remains untested. We reconstruct their diversification using a new fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny, dietary information, and geometric morphometrics. Though body shape diversified early in a manner consistent with an ancient continental adaptive radiation, trophic shifts did not always coincide with shape changes. With the notable exception of piscivores, lineages that converged in diet did not converge closely in body shape. Shifts in habitat or other variables likely influenced body shape evolution in addition to changes in diet, and the clade's history departs from many classic adaptive radiations in lakes or on islands, in which trophic convergence drives morphological convergence. The contrast between the Neotropical radiation's exhaustive exploration of morphospace and the more restrained diversification in Africa suggests a major role for contingency in characiform evolution, with the presence of cypriniform competitors in the Old World, but not the New, providing one possible explanation. Our results depict the clearest ecomorphological reconstruction to date for Characiformes and set the stage for studies further elucidating the processes underlying its diversification.},

abstract = {The Characiformes are distributed throughout large portions of the freshwaters of Africa and America. About 90{\%} of the almost 2000 characiform species inhabit the American rivers, with their greatest diversity occurring in the Neotropical region. As in most other groups of fishes, the current knowledge about characiform myology is extremely poor. This study presents the results of a survey of the mandibular, hyopalatine, and opercular musculature of 65 species representing all the 18 traditionally recognized characiform families, including the 14 subfamilies and several genera . incertae sedis of the Characidae, the most speciose family of the order. The morphological variation of these muscles across the order is documented in detail and the homologies of the characiform adductor mandibulae divisions are clarified. Accordingly, the mistaken nomenclature previously applied to these divisions in some characiform taxa is herein corrected. Contradicting some previous studies, we found that none of the examined characiforms lacks an A3 section of the adductor mandibulae, but instead some taxa have an A3 continuous with A2. Derived myological features are identified as new putative synapomorphies for: the Characoidei; the clade composed of the Alestidae, Characidae, Gasteropelecidae, Cynodontoidea, and Erythrinoidea; the clade Cynodontoidea plus Erythrinoidea; the clade formed by Ctenoluciidae and Erythrinidae; the Serrasalminae; and the Triportheinae. Additionally, new myological data seems to indicate that the Agoniatinae might be more closely related to cynodontoids and erythrinoids than to other characids. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The genus Synodontis Cuvier, 1816 (Siluriformes, Mochokidae) numbers about 120 species and is exclusive to the freshwater of Africa except Maghreb and Cape Province. It is one of the most widespread catfish of African freshwater. The Synodontis fossil record covers the last 18 Myr and most of the Synodontis fossil bones are found in a disarticulated state. The identification of the fossils at a specific level is so far impossible, because we lack an osteological study of the species. Here, we present the study of the osteology of eleven Synodontis species living in Chad: S. batensoda R{\"{u}}ppell, 1832, S. clarias (Linnaeus, 1758), S. courteti Pellegrin, 1906, S. eupterus Boulenger, 1901, S. filamentosus Boulenger, 1901, S. membranaceus (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1809), S. nigrita Valenciennes, 1840, S. ocellifer Boulenger, 1900, S. schall (Bloch {\&} Schneider, 1801), S. sorex G{\"{u}}nther, 1864 and S. violaceus Pellegrin, 1919. Each species is characterized based on its bony anatomy. The morphological variability within and between the species is discussed. The entire skeleton is described, bone by bone. A total of 61 osteological characters, both qualitative and quantitative are established. We emphasize the bones that are well preserved in the fossil, i.e. the mesethmoid, the lateral ethmoid, the frontal, the supraoccipital, the cleithrum, the pectoral spine, the middle nucal plate and the dorsal spine. As a first result, the Chadian Synodontis species can be recognized on the basis of bony characters only. Second, we are also able to attribute isolated bones to nominative species or to a group of species. At last, we note that no osteological character legitimates the distinction of the genera Hemisynodontis Bleeker, 1862 and Brachysynodontis Bleeker, 1862. {\textcopyright} Publications Scientifiques du Mus{\'{e}}um national d'Histoire naturelle.},

The improvements include the ability to assign scores of endemicity to sets of disjoint areas, and to have each species contribute more to the score of endemicity of an area, or less, according to how well its distribution matches the area. The modified method also allows for partially overlapping areas; an area partially overlapping with another one of higher score is retained when the set of lower score has a minimum proportion of species endemic to it. Algorithms to evaluate areas of endemism under this criterion are discussed, and implemented in a computer program (NDM). The new algorithms allow evaluation of much larger data sets.},

abstract = {Euglossine bees (Apidae; Euglossini) exclusively pollinate hundreds of orchid species and comprise up to 25{\%} of bee species richness in neotropical rainforests. As one of the first studies of comparative phylogeography in a neotropical insect group, we performed a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-based analysis of 14 euglossine species represented by populations sampled across the Andes and/or across the Amazon basin. The mtDNA divergences within species were consistently low; across the 12 monophyletic species the mean intraspecific divergence among haplotypes was 0.9{\%} (range of means, 0-1.9{\%}). The cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) divergence among populations separated by the Andes (N = 11 species) averaged 1.1{\%} (range 0.0-2.0{\%}). The mtDNA CO1 data set displayed homogeneous rates of nucleotide substitution, permitting us to infer dispersal across the cordillera long after the final Andean uplift based on arthropod molecular clocks of 1.2-1.5{\%} divergence per million years. Gene flow across the 3000-km breadth of the Amazon basin was inferred from identical cross-Amazon haplotypes found in five species. Although mtDNA haplotypes for 12 of the 14 euglossine species were monophyletic, a reticulate CO1 phylogeny was recovered in Euglossa cognata and E. mixta, suggesting large ancestral populations and recent speciation. Reference to closely related outgroups suggested recent speciation for the majority of species. Phylogeographical structure across a broad spatial scale is weaker in euglossine bees than in any neotropical group previously examined, and may derive from a combination of Quaternary speciation, population expansion and/or long-distance gene flow.},

Guianacara dacrya can be further distinguished from G. geayi, G. owroewefi, G. sphenozona and G. stergiosi by the possession of a thin midlateral bar, from G. cuyunii by the possession of dusky branchiostegal membranes and from G. oelemariensis by the possession of two supraneurals.

abstract = {A phylogenetic analysis based on 311 morphological characters is presented for most species of the Doradidae, all genera of the Auchenipteridae, and representatives of 16 other catfish families. The hypothesis that was derived from the six most parsimonious trees support the monophyly of the South American Doradoidea (Doradidae plus Auchenipteridae), as well as the monophyly of the clade Doradoidea plus the African Mochokidae. In addition, the clade with Sisoroidea plus Aspredinidae was considered sister to Doradoidea plus Mochokidae. Within the Auchenipteridae, the results support the monophyly of the Centromochlinae and Auchenipterinae. The latter is composed of Tocantinsia, and four monophyletic units, two small with Asterophysus and Liosomadoras, and Pseudotatia and Pseudauchenipterus, respectively, and two large ones with the remaining genera. Within the Doradidae, parsimony analysis recovered Wertheimeria as sister to Kalyptodoras, composing a clade sister to all remaining doradids, which include Franciscodoras and two monophyletic groups: Astrodoradinae (plus Acanthodoras and Agamyxis) and Doradinae (new arrangement). Wertheimerinae, new subfamily, is described for Kalyptodoras and Wertheimeria. Doradinae is corroborated as monophyletic and composed of four groups, one including Centrochir and Platydoras, the other with the large-size species of doradids (except Oxydoras), another with Orinocodoras, Rhinodoras, and Rhynchodoras, and another with Oxydoras plus all the fimbriate-barbel doradids. Based on the results, the species of Opsodoras are included in Hemidoras; and Tenellus, new genus, is described to include Nemadoras trimaculatus, N. leporhinus and Nemadoras ternetzi. Due to conflicting hypotheses of the phylogenetic position of Acanthodoras, Agamyxis, and Franciscodoras, these are considered as incertae sedis in Doradidae. All suprageneric taxa of the Doradoidea are diagnosed based on synapomorphic morphological characteristics.},

abstract = {Five decades have passed since the proposal of the molecular clock hypothesis, which states that the rate of evolution at the molecular level is constant through time and among species. This hypothesis has become a powerful tool in evolutionary biology, making it possible to use molecular sequences to estimate the geological ages of species divergence events. With recent advances in Bayesian clock dating methodology and the explosive accumulation of genetic sequence data, molecular clock dating has found widespread applications, from tracking virus pandemics and studying the macroevolutionary process of speciation and extinction to estimating a timescale for life on Earth.},

This new taxon is readily distinguished from all other Arapaima by the following three characters: 1) dorsalmost lateralis sensory cavity on preopercle extremely slender (vs. broadly oval or nearly rectangular in other nominal taxa); 2) ventrolateral margin of head where third infraorbital meets anterior limb of preopercle strongly angled such that ventral surface of head is almost flat (vs. ventrolateral margin of head relatively rounded); and 3) anterior third of dorsal-fin base covered with an enlarged, thickened sheath that hides anterior dorsal-fin rays when adpressed (vs. no thickened sheath on anterior base of dorsal fin and anterior dorsal-fin rays visible when adpressed). Distinguished from all other Arapaima except A. agassizii by having extremely long fourth infraorbital. Distinguished from A. arapaima and all other examined non-type specimens by notably slender body (the holotypes of A. gigas, A. mapae, and A. agassizii also have slender bodies). Further distinguished from A. mapae and A. agassizii by having relatively deep caudal peduncle (6.0{\%} SL, vs. ∼4.0{\%} in latter two taxa), and from A. gigas by having dentary teeth in a single row (vs. dentary teeth in 2-2.5 irregular rows). This species was collected near the confluence of the Solim{\~{o}}es and Purus rivers in Amazonas State, Brazil. It is the first new species of Arapaima to be described since 1847, and comparisons with Arapaima from Mamirau{\'{a}} Reserve demonstrate that there are at least two species of Arapaima present in Amazonas State. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.},

In spite of their ecological importance, currently, no phylogenetic hypothesis is available for this group, and we do not know the tempo of evolution of this clade. In this study, we used a supermatrix approach to assemble a dataset of three mitochondrial loci for 20 sphyraenid species, and time-calibrated this new phylogeny. Our study supports the existence of three main groups of barracudas, which we labelled the ``S. barracuda{\{}''{\}} group, the ``S. obtusata{\{}''{\}} group and the ``S. sphyraena{\{}''{\}} group. The timetree indicates a Late Paleocene age ({\~{}}57Ma) for the origin of the groups, and a Middle Eocene ({\~{}}45Ma) timing for the beginning of the radiation of extant lineages. Most extant species appear to belong to phylogenetic lineages dating to the Miocene ({\~{}}5 to 23Ma). Our study reveals multiple shifts between coral reef-associated and non-reef (usually more pelagic) habitats, as well as two independent origins of large body size within this group.},

abstract = {Here we apply a combination of phylogeographic and historical demographic analyses to the study of mtDNA sequence variation within the Blue-crowned Manakin (Lepidothrix coronata), a widespread Neotropical bird. A high degree of phylogeographic structure allowed us to demonstrate that several vicariant events, including Andean uplift, the formation of riverine barriers, and climatically induced vegetational shifts, as well as a non-vicariant process, range expansion, have all acted, at varying spatial and temporal scales, to influence genetic structure within L. coronata, suggesting that current historical hypotheses of the origin of Neotropical avian diversity that focus on single vicariant mechanisms may be overly simplistic. Our data also support an origin ({\textgreater}2 mybp) that is substantially older than the late Pleistocene for the genetic structure within this species and indicate that phylogeographic patterns within the species are not concordant with plumage-based subspecific taxonomy. These data add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the origin of several Neotropical avian species may have occurred in the mid-Pliocene, thus, geological arguments surrounding putative Pleistocene vicariant events, while interesting in their own right, may have little relevance to Neotropical avian diversification at the species level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Heath2012,
abstract = {In Bayesian divergence time estimation methods, incorporating calibrating information from the fossil record is commonly done by assigning prior densities to ancestral nodes in the tree. Calibration prior densities are typically parametric distributions offset by minimum age estimates provided by the fossil record. Specification of the parameters of calibration densities requires the user to quantify his or her prior knowledge of the age of the ancestral node relative to the age of its calibrating fossil. The values of these parameters can, potentially, result in biased estimates of node ages if they lead to overly informative prior distributions. Accordingly, determining parameter values that lead to adequate prior densities is not straightforward. In this study, I present a hierarchical Bayesian model for calibrating divergence time analyses with multiple fossil age constraints. This approach applies a Dirichlet process prior as a hyperprior on the parameters of calibration prior densities. Specifically, this model assumes that the rate parameters of exponential prior distributions on calibrated nodes are distributed according to a Dirichlet process, whereby the rate parameters are clustered into distinct parameter categories. Both simulated and biological data are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the Dirichlet process hyperprior. Compared with fixed exponential prior densities, the hierarchical Bayesian approach results in more accurate and precise estimates of internal node ages. When this hyperprior is applied using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the ages of calibrated nodes are sampled from mixtures of exponential distributions and uncertainty in the values of calibration density parameters is taken into account.},

Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: Provides more than 800 references-40{\%} published since 1995 Includes an appendix listing available mixture software Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

abstract = {Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks. Alignments constructed with different alignment methods (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that cleaned alignments produce better topologies although, paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more biased topologies.},

abstract = {Recent advances have allowed for both morphological fossil evidence and molecular sequences to be integrated into a single combined inference of divergence dates under the rule of Bayesian probability. In particular the fossilized birth-death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete morphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this statistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models by producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within two rich and well-characterized data sets of fossil and extant species (penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is generally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median relative error in the two data sets of 5.7{\%} and 13.2{\%} respectively. The median relative standard error (RSD) was 9.2{\%} and 7.2{\%} respectively, suggesting good precision, although with some outliers. In fact in the two data sets we analyze the phylogenetic estimates of fossil age is on average {\textless} 2 My from the midpoint age of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of internal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian statistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and morphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework used can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded from fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse applications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are temporally unconstrained, testing of the "morphological clock", and for uncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when controversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence dating analyses.},

abstract = {Five of six barracuda, Sphyraena jello, captured in the same area of Queensland as toxic Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni) were found to be toxic. One major lipid-soluble toxin, present in both the flesh and viscera of a pooled sample of barracuda, was chromatographically indistinguishable from Spanish mackerel flesh ciguatoxin. Signs and symptoms induced by toxic barracuda in humans were typical of ciguatera and cats and mice displayed signs indistinguishable from those induced by Spanish mackerel ciguatoxin. Purified barracuda ciguatoxin had an i.p. ld50 to mice of 55 $\mu$g/kg. Barracuda ciguatoxin had a narrow range (0.7 - 1.4 mouse units) of doses between 0{\%} and 100{\%} lethality and its dose vs. death-time relationship was similar to the relationship produced by moray eel and Spanish mackerel ciguatoxin. No water-soluble toxins were detected in the viscera of these barracuda, but a less polar lipid-soluble toxin was found in the viscera. This minor toxin represented 14{\%} of the total viscera lethality and induced signs in mice similar to the major toxin. Barracuda could be an important link in the transfer of ciguatoxin to large Spanish mackerel in southern Queensland waters. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {There are diverse controversial and contradictory models about the geological history of the Caribbean region. Some issues such as the origin of the Caribbean plate, the nature of basement of the Caribbean basins and the regional tectonics, have been in discussion during decades. There are disperse and punctual studies across the Caribbean. Application of seismic stratigraphy in regional seismic lines across the Colombian, Sin{\'{u}} Offshore and Sin{\'{u}}-San Jacinto basins suggests a stratigraphic continuity between these regions. A chronostratigraphic chart of the Colombian and Sin{\'{u}} Offshore basins based on stratal terminations and seismic facies was proposed. Seven stratigraphic stages were identified in the Colombian, Sin{\'{u}} Offshore and Sin{\'{u}}-San Jacinto basins, which, also, have been recognized across the Caribbean region. First stratigraphic stage was characterized by continental to restri cted marine deposition during a Triassic/Jurassic rifting. Second, third and fourth stages correspond with deposition of a wide carbonate platform in the Cretaceous, sandy carbonate platform during the Paleocene and carbonate and coarse-grained fluvial sedimentation during the Eocene, respectively. Another stage was characterized by rising of base level and deep-water deposition (turbidites and pelagic/hemipelagic sediments) during the Oligocene. The Early to Middle Miocene was characterized by shallow marine to fluvial sedimentation during falling base level, which was controlled by episodic events of tectonic inversion. During the Late Miocene to recent, the sedimentation consisted of terrigenous coarse-grained deposits. Stratigraphic relationships between these zones, suggest a shared geological history between the Caribbean and northern South America. The geologic continuity founded in this study is easily explained by the model of an in situ origin for the Caribbean plate.},

abstract = {The Maastrichtian-Cenozoic southern Middle Magdalena Valley Basin of Colombia contains a unique record of unconformities, strata, and structure, from which we extract the histories of exhumation of the Central Cordillera, to the west, and evolution of the Eastern Cordillera fold-and-thrust belt, to the east. This study integrates field-based analyses of stratigraphy, laboratory analyses of provenance, fission-track thermochronology, vitrinite-reflectance data, volcanic-ash geochronology, and studies of synorogenic geometries and structure displayed in seismic data. A major unconformity, the Middle Magdalena Valley unconformity, formed by eastward migration of Central Cordillera uplift during Late Cretaceous to early Eocene time, which transformed a Maastrichtian marine basin into a Paleocene depositional piedmont area. This transformation is recorded by a coarsening-upward sequence of marine shales to alluvial-fan conglomerates, which was partly eroded during further early Eocene propagation of Central Cordillera deformation. Cessation of this phase of uplift led to formation of a pediment surface, the Middle Magdalena Valley unconformity, which was buried by westward-onlapping middle Eocene to Neogene alluvial deposits. Middle Eocene to Neogene facies, paleoflow, and unconformities were controlled by Eastern Cordillera deformation. In the Eastern Cordillera foothills, growth strata and thermal history reveal two phases of folding of middle Eocene-Oligocene and late Miocene ages, prior to intense Pliocene-Pleistocene uplift. Two unconformities of early late Miocene and Pliocene-Pleistocene ages occur to the west of the Eastern Cordillera and record flexural tilting related to episodes of Eastern Cordillera loading.},

abstract = {New data from Neogene strata in northern South America sug- gest that Miocene tectonism in the northeastern Andes was respon- sible for the genesis of the Amazon River and changes in the drain- age patterns of other major rivers such as the Magdalena and the Orinoco. Here we present a new model for the paleogeographic evolution of northern South America during the Miocene. In the early Miocene, a large part of the drainage of northwest Amazonia was directed northward along the paleo–Orinoco river system to a delta in Lake Maracaibo. Uplift of the Eastern Cordillera in the late middle Miocene caused the first development of the Amazon River; however, no connection with the Atlantic was established, and the Amazon fed the paleo–Orinoco river system, which drained toward the Caribbean. Substantial Andean uplift in the late Miocene re- sulted in major changes in paleogeography: the Orinoco changed its course, the Amazon established a connection to the Atlantic, caus- ing the drowning of carbonate platforms, and the Amazon-Carib- bean connection was closed. Thus the drainage and paleogeography of northern South America in the Miocene were strongly controlled by tectonic movements in the northeastern Andes.},

abstract = {The vast mammal diversity of the Neotropics is the result of a long evolutionary history. During most of the Cenozoic, South America was an island continent with an endemic mammalian fauna. This isolation ceased during the late Neogene after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, resulting in an event known as the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI). In this study,we investigate biogeographic patterns in South America, just before or when the first immigrants are recorded and we review the temporal and geographical distribution of fossil mammals during the GABI. We performed a dissimilarity analysis which grouped the faunal assemblages according to their age and their geographic distribution. Our data support the differentiation between tropical and temperate assemblages in South America during the middle and late Miocene. The GABI begins during the late Miocene (∼10–7Ma) and the putative oldest migrations are recorded in the temperate region, where the number ofGABI participants rapidly increases after ∼5Ma and this trend continues during the Pleistocene. A sampling bias toward higher latitudes and younger records challenges the study of the temporal and geographic patterns of the GABI. Keywords:},

abstract = {Synodontis (Mochokidae, Siluriformes) is a freshwater catfish endemic to Africa. The 118 extant species are present in almost all hydrographic basins. Some species are restricted to a single stream, whereas others have a vast distribution. Synodontis is known in the fossil record since the Miocene, and its history depends on the connections among African basins through time. The identification of species in the fossil record is essential to reconstruct this historical pattern. Catfish pectoral and dorsal spines are robust, they preserve well and they form most of the fossil remains for the genus Synodontis. Unfortunately, the criteria for the identification of extant Synodontis species are not applicable to fossil specimens. Here, we define 11 original morphological characters that permit to discriminate four extant species from the Chad-Chari hydrographic system. Six of these characters are defined on pectoral spines and five on dorsal spines. We then show that these characters can be used successfully for identifying fossil specimens. In particular, we present a case study in which we identify Synodontis cf. schall and Brachysynodontis cf. batensoda in the hominid-bearing sector Toros-Menalla (Late Miocene, northern Chad). We show that spine anatomy can be a powerful tool to recognise catfish species through time and thus to identify historical diversity pattern.},

abstract = {Eight species of Serrasalminae (Teleostei, Characidae) are regularly cited from central Amazonia and from the western part of the Amazonian basin, from southern Bolivia to Colombia. In oriental Amazonia, the area of distribution of this group extends to the varzea, a biotope under the influence of muddy water, and sometimes to the lowest part of the clear water tributaries. This totality is part of a guild of Serrasalminae of varzea. Near the mouth of the Amazon, one observes a gradual impoverishment of the guild along the banks and coastal marshes of the Amapa, until the Oyapock River (frontier stream between Brazil and French Guiana). The Oyapock is also the northern distribution limit of several other western Amazonian species reported in the marshes of Amapa. The marshes of Amapa, situated on very recent sedimentary trainings, are of relatively young age. The different limits of distribution observed along the marshes of Amapa are interpreted as being the many pioneer fronts of the progression of the Amazonian fauna to the north, around the Guianian shield. The Oyapock is interpreted as the most northern front.},

abstract = {We provide a synopsis of {\~{}}. 60 million years of life history in Neotropical lowlands, based on a comprehensive survey of the Cenozoic deposits along the Quebrada Cachiyacu near Contamana in Peruvian Amazonia. The 34 fossil-bearing localities identified have yielded a diversity of fossil remains, including vertebrates, mollusks, arthropods, plant fossils, and microorganisms, ranging from the early Paleocene to the late Miocene-?Pliocene ({\textgreater}. 20 successive levels). This Cenozoic series includes the base of the Huchpayacu Formation (Fm.; early Paleocene; lacustrine/fluvial environments; charophyte-dominated assemblage), the Pozo Fm. (middle + ?late Eocene; marine then freshwater environments; most diversified biomes), and complete sections for the Chambira Fm. (late Oligocene-late early Miocene; freshwater environments; vertebrate-dominated faunas), the Pebas Fm. (late early to early late Miocene; freshwater environments with an increasing marine influence; excellent fossil record), and Ipururo Fm. (late Miocene-?Pliocene; fully fluvial environments; virtually no fossils preserved). At least 485 fossil species are recognized in the Contamana area ({\~{}}. 250 'plants', {\~{}}. 212 animals, and 23 foraminifera). Based on taxonomic lists from each stratigraphic interval, high-level taxonomic diversity remained fairly constant throughout the middle Eocene-Miocene interval (8-12 classes), ordinal diversity fluctuated to a greater degree, and family/species diversity generally declined, with a drastic drop in the early Miocene. The Paleocene-?Pliocene fossil assemblages from Contamana attest at least to four biogeographic histories inherited from (i) Mesozoic Gondwanan times, (ii) the Panamerican realm prior to (iii) the time of South America's Cenozoic "splendid isolation", and (iv) Neotropical ecosystems in the Americas. No direct evidence of any North American terrestrial immigrant has yet been recognized in the Miocene record at Contamana.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim Long-term climatic variation has generated historical expansions and contractions of species ranges, with accompanying fragmentation and population bottlenecks, which are evidenced by spatial variation in genetic structure of populations. We examine here hypotheses concerning dispersal and vicariance in response to historical geoclimatic change and potential isolation produced by mountains and water barriers. Location The temperate rain forest of southern South America, which is distributed from coastal Chile, including the large continental island of Chilo{\'{e}}, across the Andes into Argentina. Methods We investigated our hypotheses in the phylogenetically and biogeographically relictual marsupial Dromiciops gliroides. We examined 56 specimens, which resulted from field samples and museum study skins from 21 localities. We evaluated the influence of two major barriers, the Andean cordillera and the waterway between the mainland and the large island of Chilo{\'{e}}, by performing Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses on sequences of 877 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA. We further tested the contribution of the proposed geographical barriers using analysis of molecular variance (amova). We also evaluated the responses of populations to historical north–south shifts of habitat associated with glacial history and sea-level change. Results Our analyses revealed a phylogeny with three clades, two of which are widespread and contain nearly all the haplotypes: a northern clade (36–39° S) and a southern clade (40–43° S). These two clades contain forms from both sides of the Andes. Within the southern clade, island and mainland forms were not significantly differentiated. Tests of recent demographic change revealed that southern populations have experienced recent expansion, whereas northern populations exhibit long-term stability. The direction of recent gene flow and range expansion is predominantly from Chile to Argentina, with a modest reciprocal exchange across the Andes. Recent gene flow from the island of Chilo{\'{e}} to the mainland is also supported. Main conclusions The genetic structure of contemporary D. gliroides populations suggests recent gene flow across the Andes and between the mainland and the island of Chilo{\'{e}}. Differences in demographic history that we detected between northern and southern populations have resulted from historical southward shifts of habitat associated with glacial recession in South America. Our results add to a growing literature that demonstrates the value of genetic data to illuminate how environmental history shapes species range and population structure.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Rhyacoglanis, a new genus of the South American freshwater catfish family Pseudopimelodidae is described from cis-Andean portions of the continent. Rhyacoglanis is distinguished from other genera of the family by three synapomorphies: presence of a light blotch on the cheek; a connection between the middle of the dark caudal-fin stripe and the dark caudal-peduncle pigmentation; and 30-35 total vertebrae. Species of Rhyacoglanis are rheophilic and strongly associated with rapids and other swift-flowing waters. A phylogenetic analysis based on 41 morphological characters yields a hypothesis of monophyly of the Pseudopimelodidae and Rhyacoglanis. Pimelodus pulcher Boulenger, 1887, from the western Amazon basin is designated as type-species of the new genus and redescribed. Four new species are described: Rhyacoglanis annulatus, from the r{\'{i}}o Orinoco basin, with a nearly ringed dark band on the caudal peduncle, and a larger distance between anus and anal-fin origin; R. epiblepsis, from the rio Madeira basin, with numerous dark spots scattered on the body, and rounded caudal-fin lobes; R. paranensis, from the upper rio Paran{\'{a}} basin, with three distinct dark bands on the body, and 31-33 total vertebrae; and R. seminiger, from the rio Juruena basin, with subdorsal and subadipose dark bands fused anteroposteriorly, and a separate dark band on the caudal peduncle.},

abstract = {Surface uplift of the Garz{\'{o}}n Massif in the northern Andes formed a critical orographic barrier (2500-3000 m elevation) that generated a deep rain shadow and strongly influenced the evolution of the largest river systems draining northern South America. This basement massif and its corresponding foreland basement high define the headwaters and drainage divides of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Magdalena Rivers. Despite its pivotal role, the exhumation history of the Garz{\'{o}}n Massif and its relationships to the structural evolution of the broader Eastern Cordillera fold-thrust belt remain unclear. The northern Andes underwent major Cenozoic shortening, with considerable thin-skinned and thick-skinned deformation and topographic development in the Eastern Cordillera focused during late Miocene time. On the basis of widespread coarse-grained nonmarine sedimentation, previous studies have inferred that uplift of the Garz{\'{o}}n Massif began during the late Miocene, coincident with rapid elevation gain elsewhere in the Eastern Cordillera. We take an integrated, multiproxy approach to better reconstruct Andean topographic growth and distinguish between exhumation and surface uplift of the Garz{\'{o}}n Massif. We present new U-Pb detrital zircon provenance data, sandstone petrographic data, and paleoprecipitation data from upper Miocene clastic fill of the Neiva Basin within the adjacent Upper Magdalena Valley of the modern hinterland. In addition, six new apatite fission track (AFT) ages from the central segment of the northeast-trending Garz{\'{o}}n Massif (Jurassic granite and Proterozoic gneiss and schist) directly constrain its Neogene exhumation history. The results indicate that early exhumation may have initiated by ca. 12.5 Ma, but a substantial orographic barrier was not fully established until ca. 6-3 Ma, when {\textgreater} 1 km/m.y. of material was exhumed. Thermal history modeling of the AFT data suggests diminished exhumation thereafter (3-0 Ma), during latest Cenozoic oblique Nazca-South America convergence. This exhumation history is consistent with paleontological data suggesting late Miocene divergence of the three river systems, with associated transcontinental drainage of the Amazon River. {\textcopyright} 2016 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The late Miocene Gatun Formation of northern Panama contains a highly diverse and well sampled fossil marine assemblage that occupied a shallow-water embayment close to a purported connection between the Pacific and Atlantic (Caribbean) oceans. However, the diverse chondrichthyan fauna has been poorly documented. Based on recent field discoveries and further analysis of existing collections, the chondrichthyan fauna from this unit comprises at least 26 taxa, of which four species are extinct today. The remaining portion of the total chondrichthyan biodiversity has affinities with modern taxa and is therefore comprised of long-lived species. Based on known records of the modern geographic distribution range of the Gatun chondrichthyans, the fauna has mixed biogeographic affinities suggesting that around 10 million yr ago, a connection likely occurred between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Given the known habitat preferences for modern chondrichthyans, the Gatun fauna was primarily adapted to shallow waters within the neritic zone. Finally, comparisons of Gatun dental measurements with other faunas suggest that many of the taxa have an abundance of small individuals, in agreement with previous studies that proposed this area as a paleonursery habitat for the species Carcharocles megalodon .},

Recent field expeditions have led to the discovery of a selachian assemblage from the earliest Miocene (Aquitanian) deposits of the Uitpa Formation in the La Guajira Peninsula, Colombia. This elasmobranch assemblage provides a unique glimpse into the Caribbean biodiversity at the onset of the Neogene. The assemblage consists of 13 taxa, of which some are reported from Miocene deposits for the very first time. There are also new records of taxa the in southern Caribbean region. The taxonomic composition of the selachian assemblage was used to conduct a paleoenvironmental and paleobathymetric analysis of the lower Uitpa Formation. The maximum likelihood estimation of paleobathymetry suggests that the lower part of the Uitpa Formation was probably accumulated at a water depth of 100 to 200 m. This indicates a rapid increase in relative sea level or basin deepening, providing new insights into the possible causes of marine biota changes in the Cocinetas Basin during the Oligocene/Miocene transition.},

Both assemblages occur in the time span of the Huayquerian South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA). The Acre, `Mesopotamian' (Argentina and Uruguay), and Urumaco (Venezuela) assemblages are considered faunistically correlated and contemporaneous on the basis of their shared amniote taxa. The Laventan assemblage from Colombia has important faunistic affinities with the previous three but is older. A paleogeographic scenario is proposed to explain the long-distance correlation among those assemblages. On the basis of data from geology, field observations, fauna, and palynology, the validity of the Ucayali unconformity as a time marker along all of western Amazonia is rejected.

These genera have been geographically separated since the break-up of Gondwana in the Early Cretaceous, but they display similar biology and morphology. Species were distinguished by a combination of features such as head-to-body ratios, the number of pairs of ribs, and the presence of external gills, but no discrete skeletal characters were identified, and no comparative studies including all extant species have been published. I used computed tomography (CT), X-ray photography, and specimens from museum collections to describe the skeletal morphology of all species of lepidosirenid in a comparative context. I digitally disarticulated the bones in each specimen to compile a comparative atlas of the cranial and pectoral elements of all extant lungfishes, which has the potential to increase the correct identifications of specimens in museum collections. The morphology of the frontoparietal, parasphenoid, supraorbital, and suboperculum differ between species. I used those characters, along with molecular sequence data from the ribosomal RNA gene 16S, to run combined morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Lepidosirenidae is monophyletic in all analyses, but the interrelationships of the species of Protopterus vary with the different sources of character data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

abstract = {The total-evidence approach to divergence-time dating uses molecular and morphological data from extant and fossil species to infer phylogenetic relationships, species divergence times, and macroevolutionary parameters in a single coherent framework. Current model-based implementations of this approach lack an appropriate model for the tree describing the diversification and fossilization process and can produce estimates that lead to erroneous conclusions. We address this shortcoming by providing a total-evidence method implemented in a Bayesian framework. This approach uses a mechanistic tree prior to describe the underlying diversification process that generated the tree of extant and fossil taxa. Previous attempts to apply the total-evidence approach have used tree priors that do not account for the possibility that fossil samples may be direct ancestors of other samples. The fossilized birth-death (FBD) process explicitly models the diversification, fossilization, and sampling processes and naturally allows for sampled ancestors. This model was recently applied to estimate divergence times based on molecular data and fossil occurrence dates. We incorporate the FBD model and a model of morphological trait evolution into a Bayesian total-evidence approach to dating species phylogenies. We apply this method to extant and fossil penguins and show that the modern penguins radiated much more recently than has been previously estimated, with the basal divergence in the crown clade occurring at {\~{}}12.7 Ma and most splits leading to extant species occurring in the last 2 million years. Our results demonstrate that including stem-fossil diversity can greatly improve the estimates of the divergence times of crown taxa. The method is available in BEAST2 (v. 2.4) www.beast2.org with packages SA (v. at least 1.1.4) and morph-models (v. at least 1.0.4).},

The birth-death process is used as a model of speciation and extinction to specify the prior distribution of phylogenies and branching times. Nucleotide substitution is modeled by a continuous-time Markov process. Parameters of the branching model and the substitution model are estimated by maximum likelihood. The posterior probabilities of different phylogenies are calculated and the phylogeny with the highest posterior probability is chosen as the best estimate of the evolutionary relationship among species. We refer to this as the maximum posterior probability (MAP) tree, The posterior probability provides a natural measure of the reliability of the estimated phylogeny. Two example data sets are analyzed to infer the phylogenetic relationship of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, The best trees estimated by the new method are the same as those from the maximum likelihood analysis of separate topologies, but the posterior probabilities are quite different from the bootstrap proportions. The results of the method are found to be insensitive to changes in the rate parameter of the branching process.},

The description is based on a comparison with living specimens of the two valid species of the genus, providing details on their bony anatomy. The fossil fish is a new species, Auchenoglanis soye sp. nov. Original features include supraoccipital process more than twice as wide as long, straight posterolateral border of the sphenotic, parurohyal with a median anterior process, and lateral articular surfaces of the second dorsal spine lateral to the foramen. Auchenoglanis fish are known since the Late Miocene and are endemic to the Nilo-Sudanese province. The fossil record was previously limited to a few isolated spines identified as Auchenoglanis sp., and A. soye sp. nov. is the first fossil species described for the genus. On the basis of preliminary observations of the ichthyofauna from Toros-Menalla, the scarcity of Auchenoglanis in the fossil record might be due to the low abundance of a fish with a rather high ecological valence.},

abstract = {Constraining the uplift and exhumation history of the Venezuelan Andes is critical for understanding the complex geodynamic evolution of northern South America. We present new apatite fission-track (AFT) data from the Sierra Nevada de M{\'{e}}rida in the central Venezuelan Andes and compare the results with previously published AFT data for the Sierra La Culata (El Carmen block) to the north. The AFT data are combined with three-dimensional thermal modeling to constrain the exhumation and relief history of both blocks, which show significant differences. The Sierra Nevada indicates exhumation rates of {\~{}}1.7 km/m.y. from ca. 10 Ma until 4 Ma, decreasing to {\~{}}0.4 km/m.y. from 4 Ma to present; the El Carmen block, in contrast, underwent much more rapid recent exhumation, with rates of {\~{}}1.4 km/m.y. since 4 Ma. The data suggest {\~{}}4 km of relative rock uplift of the Sierra La Culata with respect to the Sierra Nevada since 4 Ma and support significant uplift of basement blocks along major preexisting discontinuities during transpression in the Northern Andes, linked to accretion of the Panama arc and indentation of the Maracaibo block. Rapid Middle-Late Miocene exhumation in the Sierra Nevada resulted from surface uplift that caused the Late Miocene deflection of the Orinoco River inferred from the Neogene sedimentary record. {\textcopyright} 2011 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Aim Capuchin monkey species are widely distributed across Central and South America. Morphological studies consistently divide the clade into robust and gracile forms, which show extensive sympatry in the Amazon Basin. We use genetic data to test whether Miocene or Plio-Pleistocene processes may explain capuchin species present distributions, and consider three possible scenarios to explain widespread sympatry. Location The Neotropics, including the Amazon and Atlantic Coastal Forest. Methods We sequenced the 12S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome b genes from capuchin monkey specimens. The majority were sampled from US museum collections and were wild-caught individuals of known provenance across their distribution. We applied a Bayesian discrete-states diffusion model, which reconstructed the most probable history of invasion across nine subregions. We used comparative methods to test for phylogeographic association and dispersal rate variation. Results Capuchins contained two well supported monophyletic clades, the morphologically distinct ` gracile' and ` robust' groups. The time-tree analysis estimated a late Miocene divergence between Cebus and Sapajus and a subsequent Plio-Pleistocene diversification within each of the two clades. Bayesian analysis of phylogeographic diffusion history indicated that the current wide-ranging sympatry of Cebus and Sapajus across much of the Amazon Basin was the result of a single explosive late Pleistocene invasion of Sapajus from the Atlantic Forest into the Amazon, where Sapajus is now sympatric with gracile capuchins across much of their range. Main conclusions The biogeographic history of capuchins suggests late Miocene geographic isolation of the gracile and robust forms. Each form diversified independently, but during the Pleistocene, the robust Sapajus expanded its range from the Atlantic Forest to the Amazon, where it has now encroached substantially upon what was previously the exclusive range of gracile Cebus. The genus Cebus, as currently recognized, should be split into two genera to reflect the Miocene divergence and two subsequent independent Pliocene radiations: Cebus from the Amazon and Sapajus from the Atlantic Forest.},

abstract = {Divergence-time estimation based on molecular phylogenies and the fossil record has provided insights into fundamental questions of evolutionary biology. In Bayesian node dating, phylogenies are commonly time calibrated through the specification of calibration densities on nodes representing clades with known fossil occurrences. Unfortunately, the optimal shape of these calibration densities is usually unknown and they are therefore often chosen arbitrarily, which directly impacts the reliability of the resulting age estimates. As possible solutions to this problem, two nonexclusive alternative approaches have recently been developed, the "fossilized birth-death" (FBD) model and "total-evidence dating." While these approaches have been shown to perform well under certain conditions, they require including all (or a random subset) of the fossils of each clade in the analysis, rather than just relying on the oldest fossils of clades. In addition, both approaches assume that fossil records of different clades in the phylogeny are all the product of the same underlying fossil sampling rate, even though this rate has been shown to differ strongly between higher level taxa. We here develop a flexible new approach to Bayesian age estimation that combines advantages of node dating and the FBD model. In our new approach, calibration densities are defined on the basis of first fossil occurrences and sampling rate estimates that can be specified separately for all clades. We verify our approach with a large number of simulated data sets, and compare its performance to that of the FBD model. We find that our approach produces reliable age estimates that are robust to model violation, on par with the FBD model. By applying our approach to a large data set including sequence data from over 1000 species of teleost fishes as well as 147 carefully selected fossil constraints, we recover a timeline of teleost diversification that is incompatible with previously assumed vicariant divergences of freshwater fishes. Our results instead provide strong evidence for transoceanic dispersal of cichlids and other groups of teleost fishes.

abstract = {The family Vireonidae represents one of the most widespread and well-known New World avian radiations, but a robust species-level phylogeny of the group is lacking. Here, we infer a phylogeny of Vireonidae using multilocus data obtained from 221 individuals from 46 of 52 vireonid species (representing all four genera) and five "core Corvoidea" outgroups. Our results show Vireonidae to be monophyletic, consistent with a single colonization of the New World by an Asian ancestor. Cyclarhis and Vireolanius are monophyletic genera that diverged early from the rest of Vireonidae. Hylophilus is polyphyletic, represented by three distinct clades concordant with differences in morphology, habitat, and voice. The poorly known South American species Hylophilus sclateri is embedded within the genus Vireo. Vireo, in turn, consists of several well-supported intrageneric clades. Overall, tropical vireonid species show much higher levels of intraspecific genetic structure than temperate species and several currently recognized species are probably comprised of multiple cryptic species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In other known Mylohyus skulls (all from the Pleistocene) the zygoma is not expanded into a laterad projecting process, but is inflated anterior to the glenoid fossa and its ventral surface provides a broad origin for M. masseter lateralis. The wing-like zygomata of M. elmorei are probably primitive for Mylohyus. M. elmorei occurs in the upper member of the Bone Valley Formation of Florida. On the basis of associated taxa it is very late Hemphillian (early Pliocene) in age. Thus it is the oldest known species of Mylohyus and more than doubles the antiquity of that genus.},

abstract = {A zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis is presented for the faunal remains from the Pundo shell midden in northern Nyanza province (Kenya), which contains Kansyore ceramics and dates to ca. 8000-7600 cal. BP. The faunal assemblage is overwhelmingly dominated by fish and molluscs, of which only the fish data are presented in detail. Taxonomic identifications suggest a diachronic change in relative species abundance, with cichlids becoming increasingly dominant, eventually comprising nearly 80{\%} of the fish assemblage. The Pundo faunal data are compared with those from a number of other Kansyore sites. Pundo confirms that early Kansyore sites are purely forager sites, with domestic caprines only appearing at late Kansyore sites (post-dating ca. 4400 cal. BP). Comparing ethological data for fish taxa found at Pundo and other lakeshore shell middens with those for fish taxa found at larger riverside sites, a seasonal round is suggested, in which short-term fishing camps such as Pundo may have been occupied in the dry season, while riverside sites were probably occupied during the rainy season.

abstract = {Species sighting records are combined with statistical models to infer whether an endangered species might have become extinct, or instead has just gone unobserved for a lengthy period of time. The challenging part of developing these models lies in dealing with uncertain sightings. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical approach to infer the extinction time of a species based on historical sighting records which may be either certain or uncertain. The posterior distribution for extinction time is evaluated using the likelihood of sighting data and non-informative priors for model parameters. All the models discussed in this paper are implemented in JAGS, a program for analysing Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A general methodology is presented and then applied to the sighting record of the ivory-billed woodpecker (IBW) Campephilus principalis. It was found that the IBW most likely went extinct between 1940 and 1945, a little after the date of the last certain sighting. The methods developed were also applied to other species sighting records as well as some artificial sighting records. Through the results, it was found that the inferred time of extinction is significantly influenced by the last certain sighting if the sighting record consists of only certain sightings. In the presence of uncertain sightings, the inferred extinction time is influenced by either the last certain sighting or the time when the uncertain sighting rate drops.},

abstract = {The phylogeny of piranhas, pacus, and relatives (family Serrasalmidae) was inferred on the basis of DNA sequences from eleven gene fragments that include the mitochondrial control region plus 10 nuclear genes (two exons and eight introns). The new data were obtained for a representative sampling of 53 specimens, collected from all major South American rivers, accounting for over 40{\%} of the valid species and all genera excluding Utiaritichthys. Two fossil calibration points and relaxed-clock Bayesian analyses were used to estimate the timing of diversification. The new multilocus dataset also is used to compare several species-tree approaches against the results obtained using the concatenated alignment analyzed under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Individual gene trees showed substantial topological discordance, but analyses based on concatenation and Bayesian and maximum likelihood-based species trees approaches converged onto a single phylogeny. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis is robust and supports a division of the family into three major clades, consistent with previous results based on mitochondrial DNA alone. The earliest branching event separated a "pacu" clade (Colossoma, Mylossoma and Piaractus) from the rest of the family in the Late Cretaceous (over 68. Ma). The other two clades, that contain most of the diversity, are formed by the "true piranhas" (Metynnis, Pygopristis, Pygocentrus, Pristobrycon, Catoprion, and Serrasalmus) and the Myleus-like pacus (the Myleus clade). The "true" piranha clade originated during the Eocene ({\~{}}53. Ma) but the most recent diversification of flesh-eating piranhas within the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus did not start until the Miocene ({\~{}}17. Ma). A comparison of species tree approaches indicates that most methods tested are consistent with results obtained by concatenation, suggesting that the gene-tree incongruence observed is mild and will not produce misleading results under simple concatenation analysis. Non-monophyly of several genera (Pristobrycon, Tometes, Myloplus, Mylesinus) and putative species (Serrasalmus rhombeus) was obtained, suggesting that further study of this family is necessary.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of the timing of extinctions (. $\theta$) are critical for understanding the causes of major die-off events and for identifying evolutionary or environmental transitions. Yet many studies have demonstrated that sampling biases and underlying statistical assumptions affect the accuracy of model-based estimates of extinction times (. $\theta$), and the added uncertainty contributed by inherent (laboratory) dating errors has largely been neglected. Here we provide a general guide (model-selection key) for choosing from among eight alternative 'frequentist sampling' (i.e., non-Bayesian) methods, differentiated by their treatment of both the probability of record occurrence and uncertainties in record dates, the most appropriate for a given record. We first provide a methodological framework to characterize time series of dated records as a function of the number of records, the size of the interval between successive records, and laboratory dating errors. Using both simulated data and dated Australian megafauna remains, we then assess how the characteristic of a dataset's time series dictates model performance and the probability of misclassification (false extant vs. false extinct). Among the four classic frequentist methods providing highest model performance, Marshall's (1997) and McCarthy's (1998) methods have the highest model precision. However, high model performance did not prevent misclassification errors, such that the Gaussian-resampled inverse-weighted McInerny (GRIWM) approach is the only method providing both high model accuracy and no misclassification issues, because of its unique down-weighting interval procedure and its ability to account for uncertainties in record dates. Applying the guideline to three time series of extinct Australian species, we recommend using Marshall's, McCarthy's and/or GRIWM methods to infer $\theta$ of both Thylacinus sp. and Genyornis sp., because each dataset is characterized by many sightings and a low variance of the interval between records, whereas McInerny's method better suits Diprotodon sp. due to an even lower interval variance.},

Osteological characters place the new taxon among the earliest known dromomerycine artiodactyls, most similar to Barbouromeryx trigonocorneus, which lived in North America during the early to middle Miocene, 20-16 Ma. Although it has long been assumed that the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) began with the closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the late Pliocene, or ca. 3.0-2.5 Ma, the presence of this North American immigrant in Amazonia is further evidence that terrestrial connections between North America and South America through Panama existed as early as the early late Miocene, or ca. 9.5 Ma. This early interchange date was previously indicated by approximately coeval specimens of proboscideans, peccaries, and tapirs in South America and ground sloths in North America. Although palaeomerycids apparently never flourished in South America, proboscideans thrived there until the end of the Pleistocene, and peccaries and tapirs diversified and still live there today. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Paleontological Society.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The history of knowledge about Amazonian biogeography is as rich as its fish community, and a fascinating theme of study in itself. Several current paradigms and controversies about Amazonian fish biogeography are rooted in principles dating from the second half of the 18th to the first half of the 19th centuries. The present work establishes a relationship between current biogeographical ideas and their old predecessors, on the basis of a chronologically-oriented historical continuity analysis. The advent of evolutionary theory has not contributed significantly to a transformation of the knowledge on the biogeography of Amazonian fishes. On the other hand, the two main schools of biogeographical thought (dispersalist and vicariant) had major implications on how Amazonian fish distribution is interpreted. The process was gradual and many hypotheses have combined elements from each of the two schools. Chronologically, practically the entire tradition of Amazonian biogeography takes place within the evolutionary paradigm, although its founder Louis Agassiz was himself an anti-evolutionist. The birth of Amazonian biogeography is Agassiz´s travel in Amazon. That document makes it clear that the author did not consider dispersal as a valid explanation for the biogeographical patterns he found. Later, Carl Eigenmann helps to spread the dispersalist tradition as a model for biogeographical explanations in fish distributions, a phase which lasted until the late 20th century. A major shift occurs with the contributions of Marylin Weitzman, Stanley Weitzman and Richard Vari, who associated the temporal framework of phylogenetic hypotheses with distribution patterns, underscoring the predictive power of vicariant biogeography. The present-day paradigm begins with the work of John Lundberg and attempts to incorporate geomorphological and phylogenetic information into integrative biogeographical hypotheses. Some emblematic problems have delayed proposition of general hypotheses on the phylogenetic biogeography of South American fishes, such as the poor state of knowledge of their species-level systematics; an incomplete distributional record for most species and sparse or non-existent data on the phylogenetic history of most supraspecific taxa. Such drawbacks are now being corrected at a fast pace. Recent advances on geographical distribution and an increasing number of phylogenetic hypotheses will allow unprecedented large-scale biogeographic analyses, including those based on event models and Bayesian inference. Thus, the biogeography of South American fishes, especially Amazonian ones, should soon experiment a new age of progress. The success of that new phase will depend on its ability to recognize and segregate multiple overlapping temporal layers of hydrological changes, and to develop analytical tools that can deal with temporal mixing.RESUMO A hist{\'{o}}ria do conhecimento da biogeografia amaz{\^{o}}nica {\'{e}} t{\~{a}}o rica quanto sua comunidade de peixes e um tema fascinante de estudo em si.

Mais tarde, Carl Eigenmann ajuda a disseminar a tradi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dispersalista como modelo para explica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es biogeogr{\'{a}}ficas na distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de peixes, uma fase que perdurou at{\'{e}} o final do s{\'{e}}culo 20. Uma grande mudan{\c{c}}a ocorre com as contribui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de Marylin Weitzman, Stanley Weitzman e Richard Vari, que associaram a dimens{\~{a}}o temporal de hip{\'{o}}teses filogen{\'{e}}ticas com padr{\~{o}}es de distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, revelando o poder preditivo da biogeografia vicariante. O paradigma atual come{\c{c}}a com o trabalho de John Lundberg e busca incorporar informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es geomorfol{\'{o}}gicas e filogen{\'{e}}ticas em hip{\'{o}}teses biogeogr{\'{a}}ficas integrativas. Alguns problemas emblem{\'{a}}ticos atrasaram a proposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de hip{\'{o}}teses gerais sobre a biogeografia vicariante de peixes da Am{\'{e}}rica do Sul, como o mau estado de conhecimento de sua sistem{\'{a}}tica em n{\'{i}}vel de esp{\'{e}}cie; o registro de distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o geogr{\'{a}}fica incompleto para a maioria das esp{\'{e}}cies e dados escassos ou inexistentes sobre a hist{\'{o}}ria filogen{\'{e}}tica da maioria dos t{\'{a}}xons supraespec{\'{i}}ficos.

abstract = {Stridulatory sound-producing behavior is widespread across catfish families, but some are silent. To understand why, we compared spine morphology and ecotype of silent and vocal clades. We determined vocal ability of laboratory specimens dur- ing disturbance behavior. Vocal families had bony (not flexible or segmented) spines, well-developed anterior and/or posterior serrations, and statistically significantly longer spines. We compared morphology of the proximal end of the pectoral spine be- tween vocal and silent species. For vocal taxa, microscopic rounded or bladed ridges or knobs were present on the dorsal process. Most silent species had reduced processes with exclusively smooth, convoluted, or honeycombed surfaces very similar to spine-locking surfaces, or they had novel surfaces (beaded, vacuolated, cobwebbed). Most callichthyids had ridges but many were silent during disturbance. All doradid, most auchenipterid and most mochokid species were vocal and had ridges or knobs. Within the Auchenipteridae, vocal species had spines with greater weight and serration development but not length. Silent auchenipterids had thin, brittle, distally segmented spines with few microscopic serrations on only one margin and a highly re- duced dorsal process lacking any known vocal morphology. Silent auchenipterids are derived and pelagic, while all vocal genera are basal and benthopelagic. This is the first phylogenetic evidence for stridulation mechanism loss within catfishes. Phylogenetic mapping of vocal ability, spine condition, and ecotype revealed the repeated presence of silence and vocal taxa, short and long spines, and ecotype shifts within clades. The appearance and loss of vocal behavior and supporting morphologies may have fa- cilitated diversification among catfishes.},

Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, a particular species may not be observed even when it is extant at a sampling point. We introduce a model and Bayesian analysis for estimating the true time of disappearance of a lineage from a section in the face of the possibility that failure to find the species beyond its observed stratigraphic range may represent false negatives. We incorporate proper prior information, including an estimated longevity of the species and the probability that it will be observed if extant. Our analysis produces a posterior density for the true extinction time of the species. Summaries of this probability distribution provide a point estimate of the extinction time, a standard deviation for the uncertainly in the estimate, and confidence intervals for the time of extinction. We apply our model to stratigraphic ranges of benthic foraminifera collected from the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian and Turonian) from Eastbourne, England.},

The calibration of molecular dating using the first appearance of a clade in the fossil record is a crucial step towards inferring the minimal diversification time of various groups and the choice of extinct taxa can strongly influence the molecular dates. Here, we evaluate the uncertainty on the phylogenetic position of extinct taxa through non-parametric bootstrapping. The recognition of phylogenetic uncertainty resulted in the definition of the Bootstrap Uncertainty Range (BUR) for the age of first appearance of a given clade. The BUR is calculated as the interval of geological time in which the diversification of a given clade can be inferred to have occurred, based on the temporal information of the fossil record and the topologies of the bootstrap trees. Divergence times based on BUR analyses were calculated for three clades of turtles: Testudines, Pleurodira and Cryptodira. This resulted in extensive uncertainty ranges of topology-dependent minimal divergence dates for these clades.},

abstract = {The molecular clock provides the only viable means of establishing realistic evolutionary timescales but it remains unclear how best to calibrate divergence time analyses. Calibrations can be applied to the tips and/or to the nodes of a phylogeny. Tip-calibration is an attractive approach since it allows fossil species to be included alongside extant relatives in molecular clock analyses. However, most fossil species are known from multiple stratigraphical horizons and it remains unclear how such age ranges should be interpreted to codify tip-calibrations. We use simulations and empirical data to explore the impact on precision and accuracy of different approaches to informing tip-calibrations. In particular, we focus on the effect of using tip-calibrations defined using the oldest vs youngest stratigraphic occurrences, the full stratigraphical range, as well as confidence intervals on these data points. The results of our simulations show that using different calibration approaches leads to different divergence-time estimates and demonstrate that concentrating tip-calibrations near the root of the dated phylogeny improves both precision and accuracy of estimated divergence times. Finally, our results indicate that the highest levels of accuracy and precision are achieved when fossil tips are calibrated based on the fossil occurrence from which the morphological data were derived. These trends were corroborated by analysis of an empirical dataset for Ursidae. Overall, we conclude that tip-dating analyses should, in particular, employ tip calibrations close to the root of the tree and they should be calibrated based on the age of the fossil used to inform the morphological data used in Total Evidence Dating.},

abstract = {Geochronology in Earth and Solar System science is increasingly in demand, and this demand is not only for more results, but for more precise, more accurate, and more easily interpreted temporal constraints. Because modern research often requires multiple dating methods, scrupulous inter- and intramethod calibration in absolute time is required. However, improved precision has highlighted systematic analytical biases and uncovered geologic complexity that affects mineral dates. At the same time, both enhanced spatial resolution through microbeam geochronology and creative uses of disparate data sets to inform age interpretations have helped explain complexities in age data. Quantifying random and systematic sources of instrumental and geological uncertainty is vital, and requires transparency in methodology, data reduction, and reporting. Community efforts toward inter- and intracalibration of chronometers will continue to help achieve the highest possible resolving power for integrative geochronology.},

Computed thermal history envelopes using apatite U-Pb dates and grain size information from an Early Palaeozoic granodiorite in the M{\'{e}}rida Andes suggest that it cooled from {\textgreater}500 °C to {\textless}350 °C between {\~{}}266 Ma and {\~{}}225 Ma. Late Permian to Triassic cooling is also recorded in Early Palaeozoic granitoids and metasedimentary rocks in the M{\'{e}}rida Andes by numerous new muscovite and biotite 40Ar/39Ar plateau dates spanning 257.1 ± 1.0 Ma to 205.1 ± 0.8 Ma. This episode of cooling is not recognised in the Santander Massif, where 40Ar/39Ar data suggest that some Early Palaeozoic rocks cooled below {\~{}}320 °C in the Early Palaeozoic. However, most data from pre-Jurassic rocks reveal a regional heat pulse at {\~{}}200 Ma during the intrusion of numerous shallow granitoids, resulting in temperatures in excess of {\~{}}520 °C, obscuring late Palaeozoic histories.The generally accepted timing of amalgamation of Pangaea along the Ouachita-Marathon suture pre-dates Late Permian to Triassic cooling recorded in basement rocks of the M{\'{e}}rida Andes by {\textgreater}. 30 Ma, and its effect on rocks preserved in north-western South America is unknown. We interpret late Permian to Triassic cooling in the M{\'{e}}rida Andes to be driven by exhumation. Previous studies have suggested that a short phase of shortening and anatexis is recorded at {\~{}}. 253 Ma in the Maya Block, which may have been adjacent to the basement rocks of the M{\'{e}}rida Andes in the Late Permian. The coeval onset of exhumation in the M{\'{e}}rida Andes may be a result of increased coupling in the magmatic arc, which was located along the western margin of Pangaea. Triassic extension is documented in the Central Cordillera of Colombia and Ecuador between {\~{}}. 240 Ma and {\~{}}. 215 Ma, although extension at this time has not been clearly identified in the M{\'{e}}rida Andes or the Santander Massif. Permian to Triassic cooling is not recorded in the structurally isolated Caparo Block in the southern M{\'{e}}rida Andes, suggesting that it may have constituted a distinct fault block in the Triassic.New fission track data from the Santander Massif suggest that it started exhuming at {\~{}}. 40 Ma during a period of accelerated convergence between the Nazca/Farall{\`{o}}n Plate and the western margin of South America. Exhumation in the Santander Massif occurred diachronously since {\~{}}. 18 Ma in distinct fault blocks at rates of 0.5-1 km/Ma, and may have been driven by east-west compression as a result of the indentation of the Panama-Choc{\'{o}} terrane to western Colombia.},

abstract = {The uplift of central and northern Andes occurred concomitantly with an important reorganization of the drainage pattern in the northern South America. In Early Miocene, the fluvial systems that flowed from the Amazonian craton towards the sub-Andean basins and northward to the Caribbean were replaced by a megawetland, the Pebas system, covering more than 106 km2 in western Amazonia. By Late Miocene the Pebas system progressively disappeared and gave place to the transcontinental Amazon River, connecting the Andes and the equatorial Atlantic margin. A previous work suggested that the reversal of the Amazon River and the disappearance of the Pebas system were driven by dynamic topography promoted by mantle convection. Based on a three-dimensional numerical model that couple surface processes, flexural isostasy and crustal thickening due to orogeny, here I propose that the response of the surface processes to the uplift of the central and northern Andes, along with the flexural isostasy of the lithosphere, can explain the drainage reversal of the Amazon River during Miocene time with no need to invoke dynamic topography induced by mantle convection. Moreover, according to this new numerical model, the timing of the drainage reversal in the northern South America is mainly controlled by the efficiency of the sediment transport within the drainage basins and the rate of the Andean uplift. Also, the present numerical experiments were able to predict the increase in sedimentation rate in the Amazon fan after the drainage reversal of the Amazon River as observed in Late Miocene-Pliocene sedimentary record. However, the proposed model fails to fully reproduce the spacial and temporal evolution of the Pebas system as observed in geological data. Further investigation is therefore needed in order to understand the dynamic interaction between surface and tectonic processes and their implications on the development of a megawetland that preceded the reversal of Amazon River drainage. Nevertheless, this work can give new insights into the landscape and stratigraphic evolution of northern South America during Andean orogeny, providing quantitative constraints for the paleogeography reconstructions of Amazonia. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The new species can be distinguished from all congeners, except from T. ancylorhynchus, by the presence of lateral space between 1st and 2nd premaxillary teeth, and by the absence of lateral cusps in these two teeth. However, T. siderocarajensis sp. nov. can be differentiated from syntopic congener T. ancylorhynchus by an entirely black with mottled red body in live specimens, densely pigmented pelvic fins with a high concentration of dark chromatophores, and the presence of 39 to 41 rows of circumpeduncular scales (vs. silvery body coloration with slightly reddish overtones on middle flank during breeding period in live specimens, hyaline to slightly pale coloration on distalmost region of pelvic fins, and 30 to 36 rows of circumpe- duncular scales). Additionally, molecular sequence shows that T. siderocarajensis sp. nov. is reciprocally monophyletic, and diagnosable from all congeners by having two autapo- morphic molecular characters in the mitochondrial gene COI. The phylogenetic reconstruc- tion still show that T. siderocarajensis sp. nov. is closely related to T. trilobatus. This is the first molecular study using an integrative taxonomic approach based on morphological and molecular sequence data for all described species of Tometes. These findings increase the number of formally described species of Tometes to seven. A key to the Tometes species is provided.},

The new species had been treated as an undescribed Tometes species because of the absence of a marked abdominal keel and few small spines forming its prepelvic serrae, features commonly found in the species of the Myleus clade of the Serrasalmidae (species of genera Myleus, Mylesinus, Ossubtus and Tometes) and also in species of Utiaritichthys. Myloplus zorroi sp. n. shares the following characters with its congeners and Utiaritichthys: molariform teeth (versus incisiform teeth in Myleus clade members); a labial row of premaxillary teeth separated from lingual row by an internal gap (versus absence of internal gap between premaxillary teeth rows); and an ascending process of premaxilla wide from its base to the tip (versus ascending process tapering from its base to the tip). Like other Myloplus species, M. zorroi sp. n. differs from Utiariticthys by having a deeper body, approximately 60{\%} of standard length (versus usually less than 50{\%} of standard length). Considering all the morphological evidence, including the presence of 13–19 low spines forming the prepelvic serrae in M. zorroi sp. n. versus more than 20 high spines forming a marked prepelvic keel in other species of Mylopus, the new species is here assigned to Myloplus.

We sampled 56 extant species and 16 fossil species representing outgroups, the seven living genera, and the extinct genus †Astephus long thought to be an ictalurid. In total, 209 morphological characters were curated and illustrated in MorphoBank from published and original work, and standardized using reductive coding. Molecular sequences harvested from GenBank for one nuclear and four mitochondrial genes were combined with the morphological data for total evidence analysis. Parsimony analysis recovers a crown clade Ictaluridae composed of seven living genera and numerous extinct species. The oldest ictalurid fossils are the Late Eocene members of Ameiurus and Ictalurus. The fossil clade †Astephus placed outside of Ictaluridae and not as its sister taxon. Previous morphological phylogenetic studies of Ictaluridae hypothesized convergent evolution of troglobitic features among the subterranean species. In contrast, we found morphological evidence to support a single clade of the four troglobitic species, the sister taxon of all ictalurids. This result holds whether fossils are included or not. Some previously published clock-based age estimates closely approximate our minimum ages of clades.},

The proposed zonation relies exclusively on last occurrences, which are readily applied to petroleum exploration. It has thirteen zones and eight subzones for the Eocene to Pliocene interval. Three zones and two subzones are defined for the Eocene, three zones for the Oligocene, six zones and six subzones for the Miocene, and one zone for the Pliocene. The zonation reveals three major unconformities: (1) a late Eocene - early Oligocene hiatus; (2) a late Oligocene - early Miocene hiatus; and (3) a late Miocene hiatus; the hiatuses are related to the collision of the Caribbean with the South American plate.},

abstract = {[1st paragraph] At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95{\%} credible interval for a parameter $\alpha$, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of $\alpha$ and sort them so that $\alpha$121000. The credible interval estimate is then ($\alpha$25, $\alpha$975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.},

The new model distinguishes for the first time distinct episodes of “thin-skinned” and “thick-skinned” deformation in the Garz{\'{o}}n Massif. The model indicates approximately 43 km of Early to Middle Miocene shortening by “thin-skinned” imbricate thrusting contemporaneous with the uplift of the nearby southern Central Cordillera (∼9–16 Ma) and the main hydrocarbon expulsion event for the UMV and Putumayo Basin. This was followed by at least 22 km of Late Miocene (3–6 Ma) “thick-skinned” Andean shortening and 7 km of uplift on the symmetrical Garz{\'{o}}n thrust and a SE-verging basement thrust fault zone. The Andean uplift interrupted and exposed the hydrocarbon migration pathways to the Putumayo Basin. 3-D volume fracture analysis was used for the first time in this paper together with the first seismic and well data published for the Topoyaco and Miraflor structures to test closure models for the Topoyaco foothills. Intense fracturing is observed in the Topoyaco basement monocline from the near-surface to depths of over 3.5 km. The high level of fracturing permitted freshwater flushing and oil biodegradation and hydrocarbon escape. In contrast, the Miraflor-1 well, located just southwest of the Topoyaco block, tested light gravity oil and is sealed from groundwater flushing and biodegradation by a backthrust.},

abstract = {The two major approaches to studying macroevolution in deep time are the fossil record and reconstructed relationships among extant taxa from molecular data. Results based on one approach sometimes conflict with those based on the other, with inconsistencies often attributed to inherent flaws of one (or the other) data source. Any contradiction between the molecular and fossil records represents a failure of our ability to understand the imperfections of our data, as both are limited reflections of the same evolutionary history. We therefore need to develop conceptual and mathematical models that jointly explain our observations in both records. Fortunately, the different limitations of each record provide an opportunity to test or calibrate the other, and new methodological developments leverage both records simultaneously. However, we must reckon with the distinct relationships between sampling and time in the fossil record and molecular phylogenies. These differences impact our recognition of baselines and the analytical incorporation of age estimate uncertainty.},

A total of 121 Phractocephalus hemioliopterus and 61 Pseudoplatystoma punctifer were tagged for monitoring within a 685 km segment, including the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex (BMHC), between February 2013 and July 2015. Long distance upstream movements were detected for P. hemioliopterus (up to 347 km) and for P. punctifer (up to 164 km) mainly during the transition between dry season and the rising water period. Both species moved through a long segment of rapids previously thought to function as barriers to migration. Several individuals exhibited long-distance bidirectional movements. Some tagged fish never left the release zone, indicating mortality, tag loss or resident individuals, which would characterize partial migration. The findings show evidence of migratory behaviour for large catfish within the Xingu River, emphasizing the influence of the hydrologic cycle on their movements. As part of the study area has become partially dewatered due to the BMHC, findings support the need of adequate management strategies to allow the movements of large catfish between spawning and feeding sites in the Xingu River.},

abstract = {A new fossil species of the living catfish genus Phractocephalus is described from fluvial sediments of late Miocene age in Acre State, Brazil and the Madre de Dios region, Peru. dagger Phractocephalus acreornatus n. sp., is known from a complete neurocranium with associated Weberian complex vertebrae and posttemporal-supracleithra, and several isolated skeletal elements. dagger Phractocephalus acreornatus is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: 1) anterior half of supraoccipital, frontals and sometimes mesethmoid with coarse parallel ridges and sulci in addition to reticulating ridges and subcircular pits; 2) mesethmoid very broad and coarsely ornamented; 3) lateral ethmoid projecting anteriorly above palatine condyle into olfactory capsule, its anterolateral margin convex and fluted, and its orbital notch reduced; 4) supraoccipital process long, concealing Weberian vertebrae in dorsal view; 5) opercle covered with rough, reticulating ridges and pits; 6) interopercle relatively deep, its outer side coarsely ornamented; 7) pectoral spine shaft ornamented with reticulating ridges and pits. Variability of the form of the much expanded supraoccipital process in Phractocephalus is evaluated for its taxonomic significance. Although dagger P. acreornatus is distinct from both modern P. hemioliopterus and fossil dagger P. nassi, like most Miocene fossil fishes from South America, this extinct species is closely similar to its relatives. Available characters provide evidence for a close relationship between dagger P. acreornatus and dagger P. nassi from the Urumaco Formation, Venezuela. The provenance of these late Miocene catfishes in lowland western Amazonia and north-central South America is congruent with paleogeographic models positing a large, north flowing ``Paleo-Amazon-Orinoco{\{}''{\}} river system in the Andean foreland basin during the Neogene.},

abstract = {The fossil and geologic records provide the primary data used to established absolute timescales for timetrees. For the paleontological evaluation of proposed timetree timescales, and for node-based methods for constructing timetrees, the fossil record is used to bracket divergence times. Minimum brackets (minimum ages) can be established robustly using well-dated fossils that can be reliably assigned to lineages based on positive morphological evidence. Maximum brackets are much harder to establish, largely because it is difficult to establish definitive evidence that the absence of a taxon in the fossil record is real and not just due to the incompleteness of the fossil and rock records. Five primary methods have been developed to estimate maximum age brackets, each of which is discussed. The fact that the fossilization potential of a group typically decreases the closer one approaches its time of origin increases the challenge of estimating maximum age brackets. Additional complications arise: 1) because fossil data actually bracket the time of origin of the first relevant fossilizable morphology (apomorphy), not the divergence time itself; 2) due to the phylogenetic uncertainty in the placement of fossils; 3) because of idiosyncratic temporal and geographic gaps in the rock and fossil records; and 4) if the preservation potential of a group changed significantly during its history. In contrast, uncertainties in the absolute ages of fossils are typically relatively unimportant, even though the vast majority of fossil cannot be dated directly. These issues and relevant quantitative methods are reviewed, and their relative magnitudes assessed, which typically correlate with the age of the group, its geographic range, and species richness.},

abstract = {Most Neotropical lowland forest taxa occur exclusively on one side of the Andes despite the availability of appropriate habitat on both sides. Almost all molecular phylogenies and phylogenetic analyses of species assemblages (i.e. area cladograms) have supported the hypothesis that Andean uplift during the Late Pliocene created a vicariant barrier affecting lowland lineages in the region. However, a few widespread plant and animal species occurring in lowland forests on both sides of the Andes challenge the generality of this hypothesis. To understand the role of the Andes in the history of such organisms, we reconstructed the phylogeographic history of a widespread Neotropical flycatcher (Mionectes oleagineus) in the context of the other four species in the genus. A molecular phylogeny based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequences unambiguously showed an early basal split between montane and lowland Mionectes. The phylogeographic reconstruction of lowland taxa revealed a complex history, with multiple cases in which geographically proximate populations do not represent sister lineages. Specifically, three populations of M. oleagineus west of the Andes do not comprise a monophyletic clade; instead, each represents an independent lineage with origins east of the Andes. Divergence time estimates suggest that at least two cross-Andean dispersal events post-date Andean uplift.},

This paper explores the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths) under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses.},

The total combined analysis (molecules + morphology) produced similar results, with well-supported Teiinae and "cnemidophorines". We present an evolutionary scenario for the evolution of Teiidae, based on molecular dating of evolutionary events using Bayesian methods, ancestral areas analysis, the fossil record, the geographic distribution of genera, and environmental and geologic changes during the Tertiary. According to this scenario, (1) all current teiid genera, except Aspidoscelis, originated in isolation in South America; (2) most teiid genera originated during the Eocene, a period characterized by savanna expansion in South America; and (3) Cnemidophorus originated in South America, after which some populations dispersed to Central America during the Late Miocene. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Geological explorations of the basal beds of the R{\'{i}}o Yuca Formation (Tucupido region, Portuguesa State, western Venezuela) resulted in the recognition of a new vertebrate assemblage that includes eight taxa: the toxodont cf. Adinotherium, a Peltephilidae armadillo, the freshwaters fishes Platysilurus and Phractocephalus, the caiman Purussaurus, an indeterminate dolphin, turtles, and the previously recognized sloth Pseudoprepotherium venezuelanum. When compared with the higher latitudes faunas of Argentina and Chile, the presence of cf. Adinotherium and peltephilids in the Rio Yuca Formation is consistent, but not conclusive, with a Santacrucian to Frisian SALMA age. The associated fauna, as well recent apatite fission track analysis, indicates that the R{\'{i}}o Yuca assemblage is more likely younger in age, specifically Middle to Late Miocene. So far, the Miocene localities of the northern part of South America have provided a less prolific fossil record compared to the southern part of the continent (e.g., Santacrucian and Friasian faunas of Patagonia), but the present work documents the surprising occurrence of two taxa (Peltephilidae and Nesodontinae) common in southern high latitude faunas of South America, implying the persistence of the Santacrucian-Friasian genus Adinotherium in younger strata from northern South America, and that peltephilids were much more widespread during the Miocene than previously recognized. The presence of these common Patagonian taxa (Peltephilidae and Nesodontinae) in R{\'{i}}o Yuca also supports the hypothesis of prior researchers for the existence of biogeographical connections between the northern and southern portions of South America during the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene, which facilitated faunal interchange between the two regions. Finally, the biogeographical affinities of the freshwater fishes and the giant caiman (Purussaurus) indicate close relationships of the Tucupido region with the ancestral distribution of the Orinocoan–Amazonian drainage system.},

abstract = {Two types of odontodes, or dermal teeth, occur in the neotropical Andean astroblepid catfishes. Both odontode types conform in structure to dermal teeth of gnathostomes in having dentine surrounding a central pulp cavity covered by a superficial layer of enameloid, but differ from one another in terms of attachment and association with other epidermis features. Type I odontodes in astroblepids, also found in all representatives of the superfamily Loricarioidea, are larger (40-50 microm base diameter), generally conical and sharply pointed, occur on the fin rays, and are associated with dermal bone. Type I odontodes attach to an elevated pediment of dermal bone of the fin lepidotrich, and to dermal bone generally in loricarioids, via a ring of connective tissue. Type II odontodes of astroblepids are smaller (15-20 microm base diameter) and blunt, occur in the skin of the head, maxillary barbels, nasal flap, and lip margins, and are not associated with dermal bone. Observations based on histology and scanning electron microscopy indicate that Type II odontodes are associated with other epithelial structures to form a putative mechanosensory organ. The odontode base lies deep in the dermis. The shaft is surrounded by a dense patch of microvillous epithelium and projects from within a pit formed by an elevated ring of laminar epithelial cells bearing several columnar, knob-like putative mechanosensory structures. Type II odontode organs have thus far been observed in only three astroblepid species, Astroblepus longifilis, A. chotae, A. rosei, where they occur in especially dense arrays on the maxillary barbels, surrounded by discrete patches of microvilli and separate mechanoreceptors. Type II odontode organs are less dense elsewhere on the body, but also occur in the skin of the snout, head, and lips. Typical taste buds are absent from the barbels of these species, but present in other astroblepids. The presence of Type II odontodes and their association with specialized epithelial pit organs are unique to astroblepids among siluriforms and may be potentially important adaptations to life in torrential mountain streams.},

@article{Fanti2016,
abstract = {Background: Following extreme climatic warming events, Eocene Lagerst{\"{a}}tten document aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate faunas surprisingly similar to modern counterparts. This transition in marine systems is best documented in the earliest teleost-dominated coral reef assemblage of Pesciara di Bolca, northern Italy, from near the end of the Eocene Climatic Optimum. Its rich fauna shows similarities with that of the modern Great Barrier Reef in niche exploitation by and morphological disparity among teleost primary consumers. However, such paleoecological understanding has not transcended trophic levels above primary consumers, particularly in carcharhiniform sharks. Results: We report an exceptionally preserved fossil school shark (Galeorhinus cuvieri) from Pesciara di Bolca. In addition to the spectacular preservation of soft tissues, including brain, muscles, and claspers, this male juvenile shark has stomach contents clearly identifiable as a sphyraenid acanthomorph (barracuda). This association provides evidence that a predator–prey relationship between Galeorhinus and Sphyraena in the modern coral reefs has roots in the Eocene. A growth curve of the living species of Galeorhinus fitted to G. cuvieri suggests that all specimens of G. cuvieri from the lagoonal deposits of Bolca represent sexually and somatically immature juveniles. Conclusion: The modern trophic association between higher-degree consumers (Galeorhinus and Sphyraena) has a counterpart in the Eocene Bolca, just as Bolca and the Great Barrier Reef show parallels among teleost primary consumers. Given the age of Bolca, trophic networks among consumers observed in modern coral reefs arose by the exit from the Climatic Optimum. The biased representation of juveniles suggests that the Bolca Lagerst{\"{a}}tte served as a nursery habitat for G. cuvieri. Ultraviolet photography may be useful in probing for exceptional soft tissue preservation before common acid preparation methods.},

abstract = {Amazonian waters are classified into three biogeochemical categories by dissolved nutrient content, sediment type, transparency, and acidity—all important predictors of autochthonous and allochthonous primary production (PP): (1) nutrient-poor, low-sediment, high-transparency, humic-stained, acidic blackwaters; (2) nutrient-poor, low-sediment, high-transparency, neutral clearwaters; (3) nutrient-rich, low-transparency, alluvial sediment-laden, neutral whitewaters. The classification, first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853, is well supported but its effects on fish are poorly understood. To investigate how Amazonian fish community composition and species richness are influenced by water type, we conducted quantitative year-round sampling of floodplain lake and river-margin habitats at a locality where all three water types co-occur. We sampled 22,398 fish from 310 species. Community composition was influenced more by water type than habitat. Whitewater communities were distinct from those of blackwaters and clearwaters, with community structure correlated strongly to conductivity and turbidity. Mean per-sampling event species richness and biomass were significantly higher in nutrient-rich whitewater floodplain lakes than in oligotrophic blackwater and clearwater river-floodplain systems and light-limited whitewater rivers. Our study provides novel insights into the influences of biogeochemical water type and ecosystem productivity on Earth's most diverse aquatic vertebrate fauna and highlights the importance of including multiple water types in conservation planning.},

The systematic position of the new species was investigated with a maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters. The resulting cladograms identify a nested set of unambiguous characters supporting the following monophyletic groups and taxonomic recommendations. Brachyplatystomatini new tribe is established for Brachyplatystoma and Platynematichthys and supported by two synapormorphies: two-chambered gas bladder connected by paired lateral tubes; cleithrum with blade-like ventral crest between pectoral spine articulation and posterior process of cleithrum. The monotypic genera Goslinia and Merodontotus are placed in synonymy with Brachyplatystoma characterized here by two synapomorphies: suspensorium greatly expanded mediodorsally, forming a massive plate approaching parasphenoid; juveniles with greatly elongated caudal-fin filaments developed from single outermost, unbranched principal rays. Bleekers genus group name Malacobagrus is employed as a subgenus within Brachyplatystoma to include B. filamentosum, B. capapretum, and B. rousseauxii. Monophyly of Malacobagrus is supported by five synapomorphies: adults developing extensive reticulated system of lateralis tubules on body; Weberian complex with thick, ventral bony platform at gas bladder attachment; subquadrangular shape of opercle; pectoral spine with sulcus along anterior edge; small, non-sutured endopterygoid. Two unique synapomorphies place B. capapretum and B. filamentosum together as sister species: juveniles with spots on and above lateral line; caudal peduncle subcircular in cross-section.},

abstract = {Here we introduce a general class of multiple calibration birth-death tree priors for use in Bayesian phylogenetic inference. All tree priors in this class separate ancestral node heights into a set of "calibrated nodes" and "uncalibrated nodes" such that the marginal distribution of the calibrated nodes is user-specified whereas the density ratio of the birth-death prior is retained for trees with equal values for the calibrated nodes. We describe two formulations, one in which the calibration information informs the prior on ranked tree topologies, through the (conditional) prior, and the other which factorizes the prior on divergence times and ranked topologies, thus allowing uniform, or any arbitrary prior distribution on ranked topologies. While the first of these formulations has some attractive properties the algorithm we present for computing its prior density is computationally intensive. On the other hand, the second formulation is always computationally efficient. We demonstrate the utility of the new class of multiple-calibration tree priors using both small simulations and a real-world analysis and compare the results to existing schemes. The two new calibrated tree priors described in this paper offer greater flexibility and control of prior specification in calibrated time-tree inference and divergence time dating, and will remove the need for indirect approaches to the assessment of the combined effect of calibration densities and tree process priors in Bayesian phylogenetic inference.},

abstract = {During the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO, 14.7-17.3 Ma), global temperatures were warmer than present, and similar to predicted temperatures for the coming century. Limited paleoclimate data exist from the tropics during this period, despite its potential as an analog for future climate conditions. This study presents new subannual stable isotope data ($\delta$18O and $\delta$13C) from a large population of Miocene Turritella gastropods from the Jimol and Castilletes Formations of the Guajira Peninsula, Colombia. Turritellids are aragonitic marine mollusks that live in shallow coastal waters, and their rapid growth rates allow for high-resolution subannual records. We compare these fossils to modern Turritella gastropods from multiple tropical localities to reconstruct subannual climate conditions. The seasonal range in $\delta$18O in the modern shells correlates with the seasonal variance of local precipitation, once temperature seasonality is accounted for. The Miocene fossils show larger (in some cases {\textgreater}2‰) seasonal variation in $\delta$18O than modern Turritella from the same location, suggesting increased seasonality of precipitation in Miocene northern Colombia relative to today. We propose that this increased seasonality of precipitation was due to a more northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the mid-Miocene. The resulting wet Miocene paleoenvironment is in stark contrast to semiarid conditions on the Guajira Peninsula today, indicating that this area of tropical South America has undergone a drastic environmental change since the Miocene.},

We conducted a literature review of species descriptions between January 1990 and August 2014. The following metadata were recorded from each article: year of publication, number of species, journal and impact factor, family(s) of the described species, number of authors, age of the authors and coauthors, country of the first author's institution and ecoregion of the type-locality. From accumulation of descriptions, we built an estimate model for number of species remaining to be described. We found 595 described species in 402 articles. The data demonstrated that there has been an increased understanding of the diversity of Siluriformes over the last 25 years in the Neotropical region, although 35{\%} of the species still remain to be described. The model estimated that with the current trends and incentives, the biodiversity will be known in almost seven decades. We have reinforced the idea that greater joint efforts should be made by society and the scientific community to obtain this knowledge in a shorter period of time through enhanced programs for promoting science, training and the advancement of professionals before undiscovered species become extinct. The model built in this study can be used for similar estimates of other groups of animals.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships within the family Alestidae were investigated using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches based on a molecular dataset that included both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. Multiple representatives of all but two of the recognized alestid genera were included, which allowed for testing previous hypotheses of intergeneric relationships and the monophyly of several genera. The phylogenetic position of the Neotropical genus Chalceus with respect to the family Alestidae was also examined. In order to understand the temporal context of alestid diversification, Bayesian methods of divergence time estimation using fossil data in the form of calibration priors were used to date the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. Our results rejected the monophyly of the family as currently recognized (Alestidae sensu lato) and revealed several instances of poly- and paraphyly among genera. The genus Chalceus was recovered well nested within Neotropical characiforms, thus rejecting the hypothesis that this taxon is the most basal alestid. The estimated mean divergence time for the alestid clade (Alestidae sensu stricto) was 54 Mya with a 95{\%} credibility interval of 63-49 Mya. These results are incongruent with the hypothesis that the origin of the family Alestidae predates the African-South American Drift-Vicariance event. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the absence of long-term monitoring data, inferences about extinctions of species and populations are generally based on past observations about the presence of a particular species at specified places and times (sightings). Several methods have been developed to estimate the probability and timing of extinctions from records of such sightings, but they differ in their computational complexity and assumptions about the nature of the sighting record. Here we use simulations to evaluate the performance of seven methods proposed to estimate the upper confidence limit on extinction times under different extinction and sampling scenarios. Our results show that the ability of existing methods to correctly estimate the timing of extinctions varies with the type of extinction (sudden vs. gradual) and the nature of sampling effort over time. When the probability of sampling a species declines over time, many of the methods perform poorly. On the other hand, the simulation results also suggest that as long as the choice of the method is determined by the nature of the underlying sighting data, existing methods should provide reliable inferences about the timing of past extinctions.},

abstract = {A specimen of a remarkable new catfish genus and species was collected in middle/late Miocene marine beds of the Puerto Madryn Formation at the base of the marine cliff of the sea lion colony area near Puerto Pir{\'{a}}mide, southern coast of Pen{\'{i}}nsula Vald{\'{e}}s, northeastern Patagonia, Argentina. Siluriforms (catfishes) constitute a most important monophyletic ostariophysan group of mainly freshwater fishes that occurs in almost all continents but it is especially diverse in South America. Catfishes are presently distributed in tropical to temperate areas and a small number of species are marine or amphibiotic. The new catfish shows many primitive features for catfishes in the maxilla, autopalatine, hyal elements, and Weberian apparatus. The genus is clearly distinguished by four autapomorphies: sand clock-shaped autopalatine, posterior limb of autopalatine widening strongly, post-articular arm of autopalatine longer, and a metapterygoid longer than broad. One tree was obtained both under equal and implied weighting with the following topology: a basal polytomy in the Siluriformes formed by Diplomystidae, Bachmanniidae, Kooiichthys and the Siluroidei. The new species appears to have been a marine or amphibiotic taxon: it was collected in beds considered to represent the Maximum Flooding Horizon of the transgression that deposited the Puerto Madryn Formation. The coast at this moment was at approximately 90 km to the west. According to faunistic evidence, the sea was warm temperate.},

abstract = {Biogeography of Amazonian fishes (2,500 species in vastly disjunct lineages) is complex and has so far been approached only partially. Here, we tackle the problem on the basis of the largest database yet on geographical distribution and phylogenetic relationships of Amazonian fishes, including all information available. Distributions of 4,095 species (both Amazonian and outgroups) and 84 phylogenetic hypotheses (comprising 549 phylogenetically-informative nodes) were compiled, qualified and plotted onto 46 areas (29 Amazonian and 17 non-Amazonian). The database was analyzed with PAE, CADE, BPA and BPA0, yielding largely congruent results and indicating that biogeographic signal is detectable on multiple dimensions of fish distribution, from single species ranges to cladistic congruence. Agreement is especially pronounced in deeper components, such as Trans-Andean, Cis-Andean, Western Amazon and Orinoco basins. Results show that all major Amazonian tributaries, as well as the Amazon basin itself, are non-monophyletic and constitute hybrid sets of heterogeneous biotic partitions. Amazonian drainages should not be assumed a priori as historically cohesive areas, contrary to widespread practice. Our hypothesis allows reevaluation of broader issues in historical biogeography, such as the predictive power of biogeographic hypotheses, the vicariant/dispersal duality, the significance of widely distributed taxa, and the need for temporal dimension in biogeographic patterns.},

abstract = {Calibration is the rate-determining step in every molecular clock analysis and, hence, considerable effort has been expended in the development of approaches to distinguish good from bad calibrations. These can be categorized into a priori evaluation of the intrinsic fossil evidence, and a posteriori evaluation of congruence through cross-validation. We contrasted these competing approaches and explored the impact of different interpretations of the fossil evidence upon Bayesian divergence time estimation. The results demonstrate that a posteriori approaches can lead to the selection of erroneous calibrations. Bayesian posterior estimates are also shown to be extremely sensitive to the probabilistic interpretation of temporal constraints. Furthermore, the effective time priors implemented within an analysis differ for individual calibrations when employed alone and in differing combination with others. This compromises the implicit assumption of all calibration consistency methods, that the impact of an individual calibration is the same when used alone or in unison with others. Thus, the most effective means of establishing the quality of fossil-based calibrations is through a priori evaluation of the intrinsic palaeontological, stratigraphic, geochronological and phylogenetic data. However, effort expended in establishing calibrations will not be rewarded unless they are implemented faithfully in divergence time analyses.},

abstract = {The reliability of a phylogenetic inference method from genomic sequence data is ensured by its statistical consistency. Bayesian inference methods produce a sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution given sequence data. Hence the question of statistical consistency of such methods is equivalent to the consistency of the summary of the sample. More generally, statistical consistency is ensured by the tree space used to analyse the sample.In this paper, we consider two standard parameterisations of phylogenetic time-trees used in evolutionary models: inter-coalescent interval lengths and absolute times of divergence events. For each of these parameterisations we introduce a natural metric space on ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We compare the introduced spaces with existing models of tree space and formulate several formal requirements that a metric space on phylogenetic trees must possess in order to be a satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We show that only a few known constructions of the space of phylogenetic trees satisfy these requirements. However, our results suggest that these basic requirements are not enough to distinguish between the two metric spaces we introduce and that the choice between metric spaces requires additional properties to be considered. Particularly, that the summary tree minimising the square distance to the trees from the sample might be different for different parameterisations. This suggests that further fundamental insight is needed into the problem of statistical consistency of phylogenetic inference methods.},

@article{Ornelas-Garcia2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesoamerica is one of the world's most complex biogeographical regions, mostly due to its complex geological history. This complexity has led to interesting biogeographical processes that have resulted in the current diversity and distribution of fauna in the region. The fish genus Astyanax represents a useful model to assess biogeographical hypotheses due to it being one of the most diverse and widely distributed freshwater fish species in the New World. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the genus in Mesoamerica, and to develop historical biogeographical hypotheses to explain its current distribution. RESULTS: Analysis of the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene in 208 individuals from 147 localities and of a subset of individuals for three mitochondrial genes (Cytb, 16 S, and COI) and a single nuclear gene (RAG1) yielded similar topologies, recovering six major groups with significant phylogeographic structure. Populations from North America and Upper Central America formed a monophyletic group, while Middle Central America showed evidence of rapid radiation with incompletely resolved relationships. Lower Central America lineages showed a fragmented structure, with geographically restricted taxa showing high levels of molecular divergence. All Bramocharax samples grouped with their sympatric Astyanax lineages (in some cases even with allopatric Astyanax populations), with less than 1{\%} divergence between them. These results suggest a homoplasic nature to the trophic specializations associated with Bramocharax ecomorphs, which seem to have arisen independently in different Astyanax lineages. We observed higher taxonomic diversity compared to previous phylogenetic studies of the Astyanax genus. Colonization of Mesoamerica by Astyanax before the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama (3.3 Mya) explains the deep level of divergence detected in Lower Central America. The colonization of Upper Mesoamerica apparently occurred by two independent routes, with lineage turnover over a large part of the region. CONCLUSION: Our results support multiple, independent origins of morphological traits in Astyanax, whereby the morphotype associated with Bramocharax represents a recurrent trophic adaptation. Molecular clock estimates indicate that Astyanax was present in Mesoamerica during the Miocene (approximately 8 Mya), which implies the existence of an incipient land-bridge connecting South America and Central America before the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama (approximately 3.3 Mya).},

In contrast, the fossil and geological record indicate that the Cocinetas Basin was much wetter during the Miocene-Pliocene (∼17–2.8 Ma). Water needed to sustain the paleofauna could either have originated from local sources or been brought by a larger river system (e.g. proto Magdalena/Orinoco river) with headwaters either in Andean ranges or the Guyana shield. We present a provenance study of the Pliocene Ware Formation, using petrographic analysis of conglomerate clasts and heavy minerals, and U-Pb dating of 140 detrital zircons. Clasts and heavy minerals are typical of ensialic metamorphic and igneous sources. The detrital zircon age distribution indicates the Guajira ranges as the most probable sediment source. The overall results indicate that the fluvial system of the Ware Formation drained the surrounding ranges. The water was probably derived by local precipitation onto the Guajira peninsula.},

This specimen represents the northernmost record of a fossil metatherian in South America and integrates a highly diverse vertebrate association, recently discovered in the north of Colombia. The La Guajira specimen is referred to the genus Lycopsis, as supported by the results of our phylogenetic analysis. This analysis also demonstrates that species of Lycopsis (L. torresi, L. longirostrus, L. viverensis, and L. padillai) constitute a monophyletic group and are placed as the basal taxon of Borhyaenoidea. Lycopsis padillai is a large-sized sparassodont with a body mass of about 22 kg. The presence of Lycopsis from La Guajira extends the geographical distribution of the genus to the entire South America, representing the sparassodont with the widest latitudinal distribution},

abstract = {Tetragonopterinae encompasses characid species of the genus Tetragonopterus, which are widely distributed throughout east of the Andes in South America. While taxonomy has recently clarified the species diversity and molecular evidence strongly supports the monophyly of Tetragonopterus, no interspecific relationship studies are currently available. Here we used a large molecular dataset composed of two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci containing an extensive taxon sampling within the family Characidae and included eleven species of Tetragonopterus to generate the first time-calibrated phylogeny for Tetragonopterinae. Our results support monophyly of the subfamily represented solely by Tetragonopterus and corroborate previous molecular hypothesis of close relationship with Exodon plus Roeboexodon and the subfamily Characinae. Internally, we found Moenkhausia georgiae as sister species to all remaining species followed by T. rarus, being both species endemic to the Guiana Shield drainages. Species-level relationships are first hypothesized and putative morphological apomorphies are discussed as support to monophyletic clades. Our time-calibrated phylogeny suggested an origin of the genus during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene. We hypothesized that the Andean geological activity followed by transformations in the Amazonian hydrographic scenario during the Miocene may have promoted most of the lineage diversification within the Tetragonopterus.},

This book presents quantitative treatments of a wide range of fundamental problems related to geochemistry and geology. It shows that trace elements, isotopes, and equations are integrative tools in modern geochemistry for studying various Earth processes. In many chapters, simple models are presented first, and more parameters are gradually added so that the sophisticated models can be perceived as natural outgrowths of simple ones. The book will help scientists and graduate students in Earth Sciences improve their capacity to understand, apply, criticize, and appreciate the available models and possibly to develop their own models. This understanding will provide penetrating insights into fundamental principles in geochemistry, geology, analytical chemistry, and mass spectrometry as well as any other fields in the natural sciences.},

abstract = {We present a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype phylogeny for Amazonian Anolis lizards, including geographical sampling within four species distributed across the Amazon basin (A. fuscoauratus, A. nitens, A. ortonii and A. punctatus). Approximately 1500 bp of mtDNA encoding ND2, COI and four transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are reported for 39 specimens representing four to five populations of each widespread species, plus eight outgroups. These new sequences are aligned with eight previously published sequences, yielding 914 variable characters and 780 parsimony-informative characters. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood reject the hypothesis that Amazonian anoles form a monophyletic group excluding Central American and Caribbean anoles, and suggest multiple faunal exchanges among these regions. Haplotype divergence among geographical populations of A. nitens, whose variation was influential in formulating the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis of Amazonian speciation, is very large (13-22{\%} sequence difference), suggesting that these populations separated well before the Pleistocene. Haplotype divergences among geographical populations of A. fuscoauratus (3-4{\%}), A. punctatus (4-9{\%}) and A. ortonii (6-8{\%}) also indicate pre-Pleistocene differentiation within each species, but temporally incongruent patterns among species.},

abstract = {Analysis of a morphological dataset containing 152 parsimony-informative characters yielded the first phylogenetic reconstruction spanning the South American characiform family Anostomidae. The reconstruction included 46 ingroup species representing all anostomid genera and subgenera. Outgroup comparisons included members of the sister group to the Anostomidae (the Chilodontidae) as well as members of the families Curimatidae, Characidae, Citharinidae, Distichodontidae, Hemiodontidae, Parodontidae and Prochilodontidae. The results supported a clade containing Anostomus, Gnathodolus, Pseudanos, Sartor and Synaptolaemus (the subfamily Anostominae sensu Winterbottom) albeit with a somewhat different set of relationships among the species within these genera. Anostomus as previously recognized was found to be paraphyletic and is split herein into two monophyletic components, a restricted Anostomus and the new genus Petulanos gen. nov., described herein. Laemolyta appeared as sister to the clade containing Anostomus, Gnathodolus, Petulanos, Pseudanos, Sartor and Synaptolaemus. Rhytiodus and Schizodon together formed a well-supported clade that was, in turn, sister to the clade containing Anostomus, Gnathodolus, Laemolyta, Petulanos, Pseudanos, Sartor and Synaptolaemus. Anostomoides was sister to the clade formed by these nine genera. Leporinus as currently defined was not found to be monophyletic, although certain clades within that genus were supported, including the species with subterminal mouths in the former subgenus Hypomasticus which we recognize herein as a genus. Abramites nested in Leporinus, and Leporellus was found to be the most basal anostomid genus. The presence of cis- and trans-Andean species in Abramites, Leporellus, Leporinus and Schizodon, all relatively basal genera, suggests that much of the diversification of anostomid species pre-dates the uplift of the Andean Cordilleras circa 11.8 million years ago. Several important morphological shifts in anostomid evolution are illustrated and discussed, including instances of convergence and reversal. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Linnean Society of London.},

The specimen was found in the locality Toma Vieja, northeast of the city of Paran{\'{a}}, central eastern Argentina. The bearing horizon is the so-called ‘Conglomerado os{\'{i}}fero,' which is putatively included in the lowermost beds of the fluvial Ituzaing{\'{o}} Formation. The ‘Conglomerado os{\'{i}}fero' is early Tortonian (early late Miocene) in age. Recent species of Salminus are top-ranking pelagic predatory fishes in temperate to tropical lowland freshwaters of South America. The aquatic vertebrate fauna occurring in the bearing bed shows a similar composition to several northern South American units such as the Urumaco Formation (Venezuela, late Miocene) and La Venta Formation (Colombia, middle Miocene).},

These identifications were based on comparison of morphological characters between the fossil skulls and the skulls of extant specimens from tropical America. The extant ariids from the Atlantic plume of the Orinoco-Amazon rivers reveal close taxonomic relationship to the fossil species. †Amphiarius paleoorinocoensis n. sp. and †Aspistor verumquadriscutis are closely related to Amphiarius rugispinis, Amphiarius phrygiatus and Aspistor quadriscutis, species endemic to areas under the influence of the Orinoco-Amazon plume. Another genus whose extant species are almost exclusively found in this region of the Atlantic is Sciades. Nevertheless, †Sciades latissimus n. sp. and †Sciades peregrinus n. sp., are closely related with Sciades dowii, found in the Pacific. This condition supports the extinction of Sciades dowii lineage in the Atlantic. The fossil †Ariopsis ariopsilus n. sp. shares many characters with extant species of the genus, which does not occur in the Amazon delta and which has no representative species in the Atlantic plume. The close relationship of †Bagre urumacoensis n. sp. to Bagre aff. marinus suggests a marine paleoenvironment with average to higher salinities. These new fossil catfish specimens from the Urumaco Formation suggest that they are ancestral lineages from both the Orinoco-Amazon Atlantic plume influence area (Aspistor and Amphiarius) and the Caribbean-Western Pacific (Ariopsis), and extinct lineage of Sciades from the Atlantic.},

abstract = {Aim To investigate the effects of river capture on the biogeographical history of South American freshwater fishes. Location Western Amazon and La Plata basins, and adjacent river drainages. Methods We used a species-dense time-calibrated phylogeny of long- whiskered catfishes (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae) to calculate likelihoods for 16 biogeographical scenarios of river capture, each differing in details of (1) landscape evolution and/or (2) models of species range evolution. We designed eight alternative landscape evolution models (LEMs) to represent distinct palaeogeographical river capture histories between the Western Amazon and La Plata drainages during the formation of the Central Andean (Bolivian) orocline (43.0–15.0 Ma). The LEMs differed only in patterns of area-connectivity constraints through time, and otherwise had the same geographical areas, time durations and dispersal probabilities. We used the DEC and DECj models of species range evolution under these eight LEM constraints to calculate likeli- hood values for ancestral area estimates. Results Divergence time estimates indicated that crown-group pimelodids emerged during the Late Cretaceous or Palaeogene (c. 72.9 ? 20 Ma) and model-selection recovered a best-fit palaeogeographical scenario with (1) a LEM with three river capture events, and (2) a DECj model of species range evolution. These results were quantitatively replicated using Lagrange and BayArea-like methods. Main conclusions The taxon–area chronogram of pimelodids exhibits the characteristic biogeographical signature of river capture; i.e. several non-mono- phyletic regional (basin-wide) species assemblages coupled with the presence of many species inhabiting more than one basin. These phylogenetic and biogeo- graphical patterns are consistent with the effects of three large-scale river cap- ture events during the formation of the Bolivian orocline.},

All occurrences of these taxa are from the upper Bone Valley Formation and further confirm a late Hemphillian (late Miocene to early Pliocene) age, or within the range of about 5.4 to 4.5 myBP for this part of the sedimentary sequence. In contrast to the common occurrences of hipparions in the Bone Valley Formation, A. stocki and D. mexicanus are relatively rare. In some dental charcters such as protocone length and crown height, A. stocki and D. mexicanus are no more advanced in their stage of evolution than the advanced three-toed horses Neohipparion eurystyle, N. gidleyi and Nannippus peninsulatus .},

abstract = {Loricariid and pimelodid - Like siluriforms - Along with undetermined percomorph-are described for the first time from Patagonia. Vertebrate fossils, including fish, mammals and birds, were found in beds attributed to the top of the Puerto Madryn Formation. These levels supposedly corresponded to the "Rionegrense marino" of former authors. Mammals occurring in the site suggest a Huayquerian age for the fossiliferous beds. The base of the Huayquerian was dated at about 9 Ma and the top is younger than 6.5 Ma. Radioisotopic dating in the marine shell beds of the Puerto Madryn Formation ranges from 11 to 9 Ma. Consequently, the section described here appears to be younger than the typical Puerto Madryn Formation from which it is separated by an unconformity. The section is correlated with the type R{\'{i}}o Negro Formation from northern Patagonia, which also includes Huayquerian fossils. Freshwater fishes were previously unknown in beds younger than the middle Miocene in southern South America. This is also the southernmost record of loricariid fishes. The association of aquatic continental and terrestrial vertebrates indicates for the first time in Pen{\'{i}}nsula Vald{\'{e}}s beds of freshwater origin. The evidence apported by fossils is also in agreement with global climate trends. The local extinction of loricariids in Patagonia possibly occurred much later than the time of deposition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of marine catfishes (Ariopsis felis) in several pre-Hispanic Mayan sites indicates their importance in the economy of the region. The present study presents a method for predicting marine catfish body size, standard length, total length and weight from bones usually recovered from archaeological sites. Osteometrical studies provide regression formulae with high allometric relationships that were derived from 36 fresh catfish. Based on the regression coefficients, reliability of the measurements and survivorship of the bones in archaeological contexts, the following measurements were used: length of the supraoccipital, width of the otoliths, width of the dorsal spine, height of the cleithrum and width of the pectoral spines. The resulting equations were applied to archaeological catfish bones from two Maya sites, Xcamb{\'{o}} and Mayap{\'{a}}n. The application of the osteometric results provides an assessment of the contribution of fish to the economy and permits the identification of fishing methods from two Mayan settlements from the Classic (250-750 CE) to Postclassic (900-1461 CE) periods.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

abstract = {Standard models of molecular evolution cannot estimate absolute speciation times alone, and require external calibrations to do so, such as fossils. Because fossil calibration methods rely on the incomplete fossil record, a great number of nodes in the tree of life cannot be dated precisely. However, many major paleogeographical events are dated, and since biogeographic processes depend on paleogeographical conditions, biogeographic dating may be used as an alternative or complementary method to fossil dating. I demonstrate how a time-stratified biogeographic stochastic process may be used to estimate absolute divergence times by conditioning on dated paleogeographical events. Informed by the current paleogeographical literature, I construct an empirical dispersal graph using 25 areas and 26 epochs for the past 540 Ma of Earth's history. Simulations indicate biogeographic dating performswell so long as paleogeography imposes constraint on biogeographic character evolution. To gauge whether biogeographic dating may be of practical use, I analyzed the well- studied turtle clade (Testudines) to assess how well biogeographic dating fares when compared to fossil-calibrated dating estimates reportedinthe literature.Fossil-free biogeographic dating estimatedthe age of themost recentcommonancestorof extant turtles to be fromthe Late Triassic, which is consistent with fossil-based estimates. Dating precision improves further when including a root node fossil calibration. The described model, paleogeographical dispersal graph, and analysis scripts are available for use with RevBayes.},

abstract = {The fossil record acts as a time machine, providing data on the morphology, ecology and biogeography of ancient species. Therefore, ideally, fossil data should be included in evolutionary, macroecological and biogeographical studies. However, paleontological data are often not used in biological research, in part because of the difficulty of extracting occurrence records from the primary literature. The goal of the Paleobiology Database is to make these records generally accessible, but unlike databases such as Genbank and GBIF, a ready-made interface to the R computing environment has not been available. We have developed paleobioDB, an R package designed to perform easy and flexible queries of the Paleobiology Database, including visualization, downloading and processing of selected data. This package facilitates access to paleontological data in a way that should allow further analysis using other packages and libraries available in R. The paleobioDB package should facilitate the integration of paleontological and neontological datasets, so that data from the deep past can be used to help inform our understanding of living biota, and vice versa.},

Due to its geographical isolation, its ichthyofauna arouses great biogeographic interest. This work intends to provide the ? rst comprehensive checklist for the shore ? shes of Trindade Island. Six expeditions were undertaken (1995, 1997, two in 1998, 1999 and 2000—in total 86 days of ? eldwork) to survey the ichthyofauna from tidal pools to reefs 30m deep. A checklist of 97 species belonging to 44 families is presented, with informa- tion on the ecology and geographical distribution of each species. The most representative families were the Carangidae (nine species), Serranidae (nine), Labridae (seven), Pomacentridae (? ve) and Muraenidae (? ve). Trindade is zoo- geographically related to the western Atlantic, since 32{\%} of its species are also found in the continental margin and 12.3{\%} are shared with the western and central Atlantic. Nearly thirty-? ve percent of the shore ? sh fauna of Trindade are widespread pan-Atlantic warm-water species. Another 14.6{\%} are restricted to the Brazilian Province. At least six endemic species (6.2{\%}) were found: Malacoctenus sp. (Labrisomidae), Scartella sp., Entomacrodus sp. (Blenniidae), Arcos sp. (Gobiesocidae), Elacatinus sp. and Lythrypinus sp. (Gobiidae). This endemism level is lower than that found on the tropical mid-Atlantic Ridge islands of St. Helena (13.9{\%}), Ascension (15.7{\%}) and St. Paul's Rocks (12.1{\%}).},

abstract = {A moderate amount of vertical-axis clockwise rotation of the Santa Marta massif (30°) explains as much as 115. km of extension (stretching of 1.75) along its trailing edge (Plato-San Jorge basin) and up to 56. km of simultaneous shortening with an angular shear of 0.57 along its leading edge (Perij{\'{a}} range). Extensional deformation is recorded in the 260. km-wide, fan-shaped Plato-San Jorge basin by a 2-8. km thick, shallowing-upward and almost entirely fine-grained, upper Eocene and younger sedimentary sequence. The simultaneous initiation of shortening in the Cesar-Rancher{\'{i}}a basin is documented by Mesozoic strata placed on to lower Eocene syntectonic strata (Tabaco Formation and equivalents) along the northwest-verging, shallow dipping (9-12° to the southeast) and discrete Cerrej{\'{o}}n thrust. First-order subsidence analysis in the Plato-San Jorge basin is consistent with crustal stretching values between 1.5 and 2, also predicted by the rigid-body rotation of the Santa Marta massif. The model predicts about 100. km of right-lateral displacement along the Oca fault and 45. km of left-lateral displacement along the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga fault. Clockwise rotation of a rigid Santa Marta massif, and simultaneous Paleogene opening of the Plato-San Jorge basin and emplacement of the Cerrej{\'{o}}n thrust sheet would have resulted in the fragmentation of the Cordillera Central-Santa Marta massif province. New U/Pb ages (241 ± 3. Ma) on granitoid rocks from industry boreholes in the Plato-San Jorge basin confirm the presence of fragments of a now segmented, Late Permian to Early Triassic age, two-mica, granitic province that once spanned the Santa Marta massif to the northernmost Cordillera Central. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

The specimen originates from the Late Miocene Ituzaing{\'{o}} Formation, at Paran{\'{a}} locality, Entre R{\'{i}}os Province, Argentina. The material described here (MACN Pv-14224) was determined just to genus because the living species of Sorubim are morphologically similar. Presence of Sorubim is in concordance with the hypothesis indicating that most extant pimelodid genera were already present by the Late Miocene.

abstract = {Existing quantitative methods for biostratigraphic dating and correlation commonly ignore one of the key strengths of the microfossil record—relative abundance data. In this study, we present amaximum likelihood-based biostratigraphic method that demonstrates how microfossil abundance can be used in the stratigraphic placement of isolated samples. Precise correlation and dating of isolated paleontological samples is not possible with current methods, which are primarily intended for the alignment of longer stratigraphic sequences. In contrast, the probabilistic approach provided by likelihood analysis results in sample age estimates with defined confidence intervals. Therefore, all the uncertainties inherent in our age assessment (resulting from small sample sizes, incomplete sampling, imperfect knowledge of stratigraphic distributions, lack of taxonomic resolution of biostratigraphic data, and underlying environmental, paleogeographic, and sedimentologic processes) are explicit in our results. We conclude with a field test of the method, from data collected from an oil well from the Catatumbo Basin, Colombia, illustrating the use of our approach in a real-world case study and highlighting how ourmethod could be generalized to a wide range of stratigraphic problems.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses which include fossils or molecular sequences that are sampled through time require models that allow one sample to be a direct ancestor of another sample. As previously available phylogenetic inference tools assume that all samples are tips, they do not allow for this possibility. We have developed and implemented a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer what we call sampled ancestor trees, that is, trees in which sampled individuals can be direct ancestors of other sampled individuals. We use a family of birth-death models where individuals may remain in the tree process after sampling, in particular we extend the birth-death skyline model [Stadler et al., 2013] to sampled ancestor trees. This method allows the detection of sampled ancestors as well as estimation of the probability that an individual will be removed from the process when it is sampled. We show that even if sampled ancestors are not of specific interest in an analysis, failing to account for them leads to significant bias in parameter estimates. We also show that sampled ancestor birth-death models where every sample comes from a different time point are non-identifiable and thus require one parameter to be known in order to infer other parameters. We apply our phylogenetic inference accounting for sampled ancestors to epidemiological data, where the possibility of sampled ancestors enables us to identify individuals that infected other individuals after being sampled and to infer fundamental epidemiological parameters. We also apply the method to infer divergence times and diversification rates when fossils are included along with extant species samples, so that fossilisation events are modelled as a part of the tree branching process. Such modelling has many advantages as argued in the literature. The sampler is available as an open-source BEAST2 package (https://github.com/CompEvol/sampled-ancestors).},

abstract = {Fish biomass, species richness and composition were compared between upland streams draining two contrasting geological units (Pebas and Tsa) in Colombian Amazonia. Because Pebas sediments reportedly show higher levels of base concentrations than Tsa sediments, we expected that the fish communities from the Pebas streams would show highest biomass and species richness, and that the species composition would vary between the two upland systems. Eight forest streams were sampled in four locations, applying four daily sampling events. Tsa soil samples were comparatively sandy, whereas Pebas soil samples tended to be siltier, with higher levels of exchangeable acidity, Ca, Mg and total bases. Conductivity, concentrations of bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na), bicarbonates and temperature showed higher values in Pebas stream-water samples than in Tsa. In total, 7696 fish individuals were captured, belonging to eight orders, 28 families and 122 species. Pebas streams had 1.3 times more species than Tsa streams, and more than twice the total biomass. Species richness and biomass were highly correlated with conductivity and water concentrations of Mg and Na, and biomass alone with dissolved oxygen. Fish species composition differed significantly between the geological units. Species turnover was not related to distance between sampling locations.

abstract = {Species with fragmented distributions are particularly useful models for investigating processes underlying biological diversification in the Neotropics. The Phaeothlypis wood-warbler complex (Aves: Parulidae) is comprised of six disjunct or parapatric populations. The geographic distribution of these six populations mirrors the classic map of Neotropical areas of endemism that were originally proposed as putative Pleistocene forest refugia, but the magnitude of mitochondrial DNA divergence between these populations suggests that they are each substantially older, with origins in the late Pliocene. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on long mtDNA coding sequences show that the Guiana Shield and Atlantic Forest populations are sister lineages, and group this combined lineage and the remaining four population-specific lineages in a five-way hard polytomy. MtDNA-based phylogenetic reconstructions provide no evidence that the three populations with conspicuous yellow rump and tail feathers currently grouped as the Buff-rumped Warbler (P. fulvicauda) form a monophyletic group. Furthermore, there is a broad discordance between mtDNA and plumage along a transect just east of the Andes, where the contact zone between highly divergent mtDNA clades is more than 1000km north of the phenotypic hybrid zone between the bright and dark plumage forms. This discordance between mtDNA genotype and plumage phenotype is similar to patterns seen on a finer geographic scale in other avian hybrid zones and may result from asymmetric introgression of the bright plumage trait. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Paleosols in northern Venezuela, which have formed in residual regoliths of metaargillite rock complexes, have been considered to have developed in tropical, humid climates at low elevation. Their reddish colors and clay-enriched horizons have been used to support the hypothesis of significant recent uplift of the Andes Mountains in Late Quaternary time. We suggest an alternative hypothesis of long-term (+ 5 Myr) pedogenesis in a paleohydrogeochemical regime, characterized by fluctuating redox conditions at high elevation (2000-2500 m a.s.l.); the evidence for this redox history is the presence of Mn-Fe nodules in the surface epipedon. The sites, though relatively dry now, are interpreted to have been much wetter in the past, with soil moisture levels capable of translocating clay to form argillic horizons. The presence of thick Ah horizons, complete with large (1-2 mm) Mn-Fe nodules and approximately 30 cm thick argillic horizons, suggests long-term pedogenesis. The previous classification of these paleosols as Oxisols is untenable because of the presence of a mollic epipedon and the concentration of Mn-Fe nodules in the epipedon. The paleosols bear some resemblance to Placosols of the Canadian taxonomy. previously described for the maritime cool, moist climates of the Pacific and North Atlantic areas of Canada, but in Venezuela they occur without an impermeable subsurface Fe oxide layer. In the US taxonomy, they are classified as Typic or Aridic Argiustolls. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome-b sequence data from 13 of the 15 currently recognized species of New World porcupines were used to test competing taxonomic hypotheses and to explore scenarios of morphological evolution and biogeography. Consistent with previous studies, the monophyly of Erethizontidae (Chaetomys + Erethizon + Coendou) and the monophyly of Erethizontinae (Erethizon + Coendou) were both strongly supported. However, cytochrome- b sequence data provide no support for the reciprocal monophyly of Coendou, “Echinoprocta,” and “Sphiggurus” as those taxa were previously recognized by authors. All of the erethizontid species recognized in recent revisionary work and represented by multiple sequences in this study were recovered as monophyletic groups. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses of these data recovered the following phylogeny for 11 species of Coendou: ((melanurus (ichillus (pruinosus + vestitus))) ((spinosus (bicolor + nycthemera)) (prehensilis (mexicanus (quichua + rufescens))))). Ancestral-state reconstructions based on the ML topology suggest that several morphological characters emphasized in past erethizontid classifications (size, nasofrontal sinus inflation, and long fur) have evolved homoplasiously Maximum-likelihood inference of geographic range evolution suggests that the last common ancestor of living erethizontids was a cis-Andean species, and that most subsequent cladogenesis was also cis-Andean; however, at least two trans-Andean dispersal events are plausibly indicated, as well as two separate invasions of Andean landscapes. Among the most remarkable results of this study are almost-identical sequences of Coendou prehensilis from localities spanning 27° of latitude and 25° of longitude; we speculate that a trophic-niche shift might have allowed rapid range expansion of this species, which accounts for almost all known cases of geographic range overlap and sympatry in the genus Coendou. },

abstract = {The idea of an area of endemism implies that different groups of plants and animals should have largely coincident distributions. This paper analyses an area of 1152000km2, between parallels 21 and 32S and meridians 70 and 53W to examine whether a large and taxonomically diverse data set actually displays areas supported by different groups. The data set includes the distribution of 805 species of plants (45 families), mammals (25 families), reptiles (six families), amphibians (five families), birds (18 families), and insects (30 families), and is analysed with the optimality criterion (based on the notion of endemism) implemented in the program NDM/VNDM. Almost 50{\%} of the areas obtained are supported by three or more major groups; areas supported by fewer major groups generally contain species from different genera, families, or orders.},

abstract = {Attempts at historical reconstruction are based on limited data. We are more likely to produce accurate historical reconstructions by utilizing information from diverse sources and pooling data within the relevant research communities which will allow us to build up a moving picture of the geological, climatic, and biological evolution of our planet. We suggest that dated phylogenies of plants can contribute greatly to a better understanding of Earth history. Timing of phylogenetic splits of lowland restricted lineages on either side of the Andes could provide information on the timing of montane uplift and associated climatic changes. The timing of the arrival and diversification of organisms restricted to specific climatic regimes at a particular altitude can provide information on the age at which mountains reached a height adequate for that climate once corrected for global climate changes. As a model for study, we discuss how dated phylogenies in biome rich Colombia may contribute to an understanding of geological and climatic change in north-western South America. Lowland wet forest restricted lineages separated from the mid-Miocene, whereas lineages primarily restricted to mid-altitude cloud forests began to diversify from the mid- to late-Miocene and the majority of high-altitude P{\'{a}}ramo lineages began to diversify during the Pliocene. The age of diversification of altitudinally restricted lineages therefore gives an indication of the age at which particular altitudes may have been reached.},

Here we report coral morphospecies attributed to the families Acroporidae, Agathiphylliidae, Astrocoeniidae, Caryophylliidae, Diploastraeidae, Merulinidae, and Montastraeidae. Eighteen species belonging to these seven families, included in nine genera, are described. Fifteen species are assigned to established taxa, while three remain in open nomenclature. Of the species identified, only Montastraea cavernosa (Linnaeus, 1767) exists today. The coral taxa described are typical of the Oligocene–Miocene transition and were important components of shallow-water reefs in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region during this period. The occurrence of Agathiphyllia spp., Antiguastrea , and Diploastrea spp. confirms the presence of these genera in the Miocene of the Southern Caribbean. Coral assemblages suggest that the La Guajira coral community thrived in calm and shallow waters.},

abstract = {We describe fossil catfish (Siluriformes) material from late Miocene through Pleistocene strata of Southeastern Europe. The material under study is represented by disarticulated bones from 26 localities in the territory of Southern Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Catfish fossils in that region are represented by members of two genera, Heterobranchus and Silurus, of two families (Clariidae and Siluridae, respectively), and five species, including one as new for science (Silurus spinosus n. sp.) and two described in open nomenclature (Silurus cf. S. glanis, Silurus sp.). The presence of † Heterobranchus austriacus in the late Sarmatian of Southern Ukraine can be explained by expansion of this species from Africa to Europe during the late Miocene (earlier remains of this taxon were documented only in Central and Western Europe). Geographic distribution of Silurus soldatovi was broader in the past as indicated by the numerous findings of its bones in the late Miocene and Pliocene deposits of Southeastern Europe. Modern Silurus glanis first appeared during the final stage of late Miocene (Pontian) and probably supplanted S. soldatovi because of its wider ecological plasticity (especially temperature tolerance - this species can spawn in cooler waters). An interesting evolutionary trend has been observed in the change of size, shape and orientation of denticulations on the shaft of pectoral-fin spine in different species of the genus Silurus. Such tendency may be explained in terms of the oligomerization of homologous structures, but this question deserves a special study and is not addressed herein.},

abstract = {A very significant part of the world's freshwater ichthyofauna is represented by ancient, exceptionally diverse and cosmopolitan ray-finned teleosts of the order Siluriformes. Over the years, catfish have been established as an exemplary model for probing historical biogeography at various scales. Yet, several tantalizing gaps still exist in their phylogenetic history, timeline and mode of diversification. Here, we re-examine the phylogeny of catfish by assembling and analyzing almost all publicly available mitogenome data. We constructed an ingroup matrix of 62 full-length mitogenome sequences from 20 catfish families together with four cypriniform outgroups, spanning 15,557 positions in total. Partitioned maximum likelihood analyses and Bayesian relaxed clock dating using fossil age constraints provide some useful and novel insights into the evolutionary history of this group. Loricarioidei are recovered as the first siluriform group to diversify, rendering Neotropics the cradle of the order. The next deepest clade is the South American Diplomystoidei placed as a sister group to all the remaining Siluroidei. The two multifamilial clades of "Big Asia" and "Big Africa" are also recovered, albeit nodal support for the latter is poor. Within "Big Asia", Bagridae are clearly polyphyletic. Other interfamilial relationships, including Clariidae + Heteropneustidae, Doradidae + Auchenipteridae and Ictaluridae + Cranoglanididae are robustly resolved. Our chronogram shows that siluriforms have a Pangaean origin, at least as far back as the Early Cretaceous. The inferred timeline of the basal splits corroborates the "Out-of-South America" hypothesis and accords well with the fossil record. The divergence of Siluroidei most likely postdated the final separation of Africa and South America. An appealing case of phylogenetic affinity elaborated by biogeographic dispersal is exemplified by the Early Paleogene split between the Southeast Asian Cranoglanididae and Ictaluridae, with the latter radiating into North America's freshwater realm by Eocene. The end of Cretaceous probably concludes the major bout of diversification at the family level while with the dawn of the Cenozoic a prolific radiation is evident at the generic level.},

Eleven were identified as already established species including seven genera belonging to the families Mussidae, Pocilloporidae, Poritidae, Siderastreidae, and Milleporidae; the other three remain in open nomenclature. Nine of the 11 species identified (81{\%}) are extinct. The remaining two living species, Siderastrea siderea and Millepora alcicornis , are common on modern Caribbean reefs. Their presence in the Siaman{\'{a}} Formation extends their temporal range in the Caribbean region to the early Miocene. Most of the taxa described here were hermatypic and zooxanthellate corals of the order Scleractinia, with the exception of the fire coral Millepora alcicornis , of the order Anthothecata, family Milleporidae. The coral fauna recorded in the Siaman{\'{a}} and Jimol formations is typical of shallow and calm waters of the Oligocene–Miocene transition.},

abstract = {We use the small-bodied toucan genus Pteroglossus to test hypotheses about diversification in the lowland Neotropics. We sequenced three mitochondrial genes and one nuclear intron from all Pteroglossus species and used these data to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. These phylogenetic trees were used to make inferences regarding both the pattern and timing of diversification for the group. We used the uplift of the Talamanca highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama as a geologic calibration for estimating divergence times on the Pteroglossus tree and compared these results with a standard molecular clock calibration. Then, we used likelihood methods to model the rate of diversification. Based on our analyses, the onset of the Pteroglossus radiation predates the Pleistocene, which has been predicted to have played a pivotal role in diversification in the Amazon rainforest biota. We found a constant rate of diversification in Pteroglossus evolutionary history, and thus no support that events during the Pleistocene caused an increase in diversification. We compare our data to other avian phylogenies to better understand major biogeographic events in the Neotropics. These comparisons support recurring forest connections between the Amazonian and Atlantic forests, and the splitting of cis/trans Andean species after the final uplift of the Andes. At the subspecies level, there is evidence for reciprocal monophyly and groups are often separated by major rivers, demonstrating the important role of rivers in causing or maintaining divergence. Because some of the results presented here conflict with current taxonomy of Pteroglossus, new taxonomic arrangements are suggested. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Bicudo2020,
abstract = {The Cenozoic landscape of northern South America evolved under the influence of different geodynamic processes, culminating in the formation of the largest drainage basin on Earth, the Amazon drainage system. The orogeny of the Andean cordillera and the increase in surface denudation induced an asymmetric influx of sediments in Amazonia, which caused an eastward propagation of the Andean sedimentary wedge, reversing the topographic gradient and driving the drainage flow towards the Atlantic Equatorial margin. The low-relief topography of lowlands in Amazonia is also a factor that propitiates this reversal. Concomitantly, variations in the subduction angle of the Nazca plate under the continental lithosphere during the Miocene also contributed to create dynamic topography that perturbed the surface and modified the drainage pattern through time. In the last decade, both surface processes during Andean orogeny and dynamic topography were invoked independently to explain the formation of the present Amazon drainage system connecting the Andes and the equatorial margin. However, hitherto these mechanisms were not considered in a single model, hampering the evaluation of the contribution of each factor on the evolution of the Amazon River. To quantify the combined effect of the different geodynamic processes, in the present work we used numerical models that integrate orogeny, surface processes, dynamic topography and flexural isostasy of the lithosphere. In our results, we present new numerical scenarios for the Cenozoic landscape evolution of Amazonia, showing that the dynamic topography may have affected the environmental evolution in western Amazonia, favoring the development of a megawetland in this region before the establishment of the Amazon River as a transcontinental river. We conclude that, although the formation of the Amazon drainage system can be explained without the influence of mantle convection, variations in dynamic topography may have anticipated the establishment of the transcontinental drainage system a few million years. Furthermore, the stratigraphic evolution and the total Cenozoic sedimentation preserved in the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is a function of the temporal variations in the amplitude of dynamic topography in northern South America.},

abstract = {Fish species of the Zungaro genus (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae) are amongst the largest migratory fish in Latin America and have considerable economic importance for commercial fishing in Brazil. However, natural populations of this large catfish are experiencing a severe decline. There are significant taxonomical inconsistencies for this fish. Two geographically separated species of the fish were initially described, one endemic in the Amazon and another in the Paran{\'{a}}-Paraguay River basins. A taxonomic review had recently proposed that there is only one Zungaro species in Brazil, based on morphological data. We made a molecular study of Zungaro populations in an attempt to solve taxonomical inconsistencies and to analyze genetic diversity in natural populations of this genus. We analyzed two regions of the mitochondrial DNA (the control region and the ATPase 6 gene region) of individuals sampled from the Paran{\'{a}}-Paraguay River and Amazon River basins. Analyses based on p-distances and maximum likelihood phylogenetic models showed a genetic difference between populations corresponding to different species. Genetic differentiation between Zungaro populations was at the same level as that observed between other Siluriformes species, using the same DNA sequences. We conclude that Zungaro species of the Paran{\'{a}}-Paraguay River basin do not belong to the same species found in the Amazon basin. This finding has a significant implication for conservation of this fish, given that populations are disappearing at a high rate in the Paran{\'{a}}-Paraguay River basin, mainly due to impoundments.},

The new taxon belongs to the extinct order of 'South American native ungulate' Litopterna characterized by the convergence of the later forms with the equids and camelids. Notolophus arquinotiensis shows closest relationships with Victor-lemoinea from the Itaboraian (middle Palaeocene) of Brazil and Riochican-Vacan (late Palaeocene-early Eocene) of Patagonia, Argentina. Although still poorly documented, this new taxon shows that the early Palaeogene Antarctic faunas might provide key data concerning the problems of the origin, diversity and basal phylogeny of some of the 'South American ungulates' (Litopterna).

abstract = {Widespread wrench tectonics have been described along the northern Andes. The Bucaramanga fault, described as sinistral strike-slip, bounds the high Santander Massif. We combine structural and thermochronological data from the central-southern portion of the fault to investigate the vertical displacement. The structural survey data show old phases of activity preserved in the host rocks along the fault trace, with the superimposition of different generations of slickenlines, and both strike-slip and dip-slip kinematics indicators. New and previous thermochronological data show that differential exhumation of the fault walls has been ongoing for the last 50 Ma. The hanging wall, the Santander Massif, records, in the central portion, decreasing exhumation rates from the early Miocene to the mid-to late Miocene and, in the southern portion, constant rates from the Late Oligocene to the Pliocene. Combining such observations, the thermochronological offset resulting from the relative motion of the two fault walls is comparable with the observed drop in elevation across the fault, suggesting that the present topography of the Santander Massif is related to vertical movement along the Bucaramanga fault. We infer that the fault has a significant Neogene reverse component, consistent with the present day horizontal global positioning system vector data, long-term exhumation rates and the structural assemblage.},

abstract = {Pliocene age deposits of the palaeo-Orinoco Delta are evaluated in the Mayaro Formation, which crops out along the western margin of the Columbus Basin in south-east Trinidad. This sandstone-dominated interval records the diachronous, basinwards migration of the shelf edge of the palaeo-Orinoco Delta, as it prograded eastwards during the Pliocene–Pleistocene (ca 3{\textperiodcentered}5 Ma). The basin setting was characterized by exceptionally high rates of growth-fault controlled sediment supply and accommodation space creation resulting in a gross basin-fill of around 12 km, with some of the highest subsidence rates in the world (ca 5 to 10 m ka−1). This analysis demonstrates that the Mayaro Formation was deposited within large and mainly wave-influenced shelf-edge deltas. These are manifested as multiple stacks of coarsening upward parasequences at scales ranging from tens to hundreds of metres in thickness, which are dominated by storm-influenced and wave-influenced proximal delta-front sandstones with extensive, amalgamated swaley and hummocky cross-stratification. These proximal delta-front successions pass gradationally downwards into 10s to 100 m thick distal delta front to mud-dominated upper slope deposits characterized by a wide variety of sedimentary processes, including distal river flood and storm-related currents, slumps and other gravity flows. Isolated and subordinate sandstone bodies occur as gully fills, while extensive soft sediment deformation attests to the high sedimentation rates along a slope within a tectonically active basin. The vertical stratigraphic organization of the facies associations, together with the often cryptic nature of parasequence stacking patterns and sequence stratigraphic surfaces, are the combined product of the rapid rates of accommodation space creation, high rates of sediment supply and glacio-eustasy in the 40 to 100 Ka Milankovitch frequency range. The stratigraphic framework described herein contrasts strikingly with that described from passive continental margins, but compares favourably to other tectonically active, deltaic settings (for example, the Baram Delta Province of north-west Borneo).},

abstract = {Recent studies have improved our understand- ing of Amazonian geological history during the late Tertiary and Quaternary, two periods regarded as critical for the recent diversification of the Amazonian avifauna. The notion that geologically older and more stable areas of Amazonia (such as the Brazilian and Guianan shields) functioned as ‘‘species-pumps'', whereas geologically more dynamic areas (such as the western Amazonian lowlands) mostly ‘‘captured'' part of the diversity generated nearby, was supported by a recent phylogeographic study focusing on a species complex of the genus Xiphorhynchus (Den- drocolaptidae). Here, we review several additional molecular datasets to assess whether this historical scenario can be extended to other lineages of Amazonian birds as well. The datasets reviewed indicated that most lineages of upland forest species found nowadays in western Amazonia are associated with more basal lineages from the Brazilian shield, Guianan shield, and the Andes, indicating a more recent history in this geologically dynamic region. Con- versely, lineages associated with seasonally flooded forests seem to have an ancient history in western Amazonia, apparently expanding over the geologically more stable areas only recently. Most sister taxa of the lineages reviewed exhibited levels of pairwise sequence divergence consistent with splitting events dating back to a time frame stretching from the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene, a period when significant physiographic and landscape changes took place in Amazonia. When interpreted toge- ther, all the studies reviewed provide evidence that geology and landscape evolution are tightly linked with the timing and mode of differentiation of Amazonian birds.},

abstract = {For almost a decade now, a team of molecular evolutionists has produced a plethora of seemingly precise molecular clock estimates for divergence events ranging from the speciation of cats and dogs to lineage separations that might have occurred ∼4 billion years ago. Because the appearance of accuracy has an irresistible allure, non-specialists frequently treat these estimates as factual. In this article, we show that all of these divergence-time estimates were generated through improper methodology on the basis of a single calibration point that has been unjustly denuded of error. The illusion of precision was achieved mainly through the conversion of statistical estimates (which by definition possess standard errors, ranges and confidence intervals) into errorless numbers. By employing such techniques successively, the time estimates of even the most ancient divergence events were made to look deceptively precise. For example, on the basis of just 15 genes, the arthropod-nematode divergence event was 'calculated' to have occurred 1167±83 million years ago (i.e. within a 95{\%} confidence interval of ∼350 million years). Were calibration and derivation uncertainties taken into proper consideration, the 95{\%} confidence interval would have turned out to be at least 40 times larger (∼14.2 billion years).},

All the family-group names proposed for fossil fishes found to date are listed, together with their author(s) and year of publication. The main goal of the list is to contribute to the usage of the correct family-group names for fossil fishes with a uniform spelling and to list the author(s) and date of those names.

abstract = {The Neotropical crocodylian species, Caiman crocodilus, is widely distributed through Mesoamerica, northern South America, and the Amazon basin. Four subspecies are recognized within C. crocodilus, suggesting some geographic variation in morphology. In this study, we utilized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from 45 individuals of C. crocodilus throughout its range to infer its evolutionary history and population structure, as well as to evaluate genealogical support for subspecies and their geographic distributions. Our molecular phylogenetic results identified five mtDNA haplotype clades with a mean sequence divergence of 3.4{\%}, indicating considerable evolutionary independence among phylogeographic lineages. Our results were also broadly consistent with current subspecific taxonomy, with some important additional findings. First, we found substantial genetic structuring within C. c. fuscus from southern Mesoamerica. Second, though we confirmed the existence of a widespread Amazonian clade, we also discovered a cryptic and divergent mtDNA lineage that was indistinguishable from C. c. crocodilus based on external morphology. Third, we confirm the status of C. c. chiapasius as a distinct evolutionary lineage, and provide evidence that C. c. fuscus may be moving northward and hybridizing with C. c. chiapasius in northern Mesoamerica. Finally, our results parallel previous phylogeographic studies of other organisms that have demonstrated significant genetic structure over shorter geographic distances in Mesoamerica compared with Amazonia. We support conservation efforts for all five independent lineages within C. crocodilus, and highlight the subspecies C. c. chiapasius as a unit of particular conservation concern.},

The fossils are from two discernible horizons, both probably of late Miocene age and separated by the Ucayali Unconformity. The older horizon is the upper part of the Contamana Group, whereas the younger horizon is Unit A of the Madre de Dios Formation. The Contamana Group has yielded specimens identifiable as Stupendemys, a very large podocnemidid reported from Venezuela and Amazonia, and a new and unnamed taxon of podocnemidid represented only by the lower jaw. It is possible that the lower jaw belongs to Stupendemys, but the absence of any associated specimens prevents this assignment. The younger Madre de Dios horizon also yields Stupendemys, demonstrating that this large turtle lived both before and after the event that gave rise to the Ucayali Unconformity. A cervical attributable to a large species of Podocnemis was found in beds identified as either Unit A or upper Contamana Group},

abstract = {The middle–upper Miocene (Serravallian-Tortonian) Gatun Formation of Panama is one of the most diverse marine fossil assemblages in the Caribbean, and has been widely used as a baseline in studies investigating the effects of the late Neogene closure of the Central American Seaway. Despite being the focus of exhaustive paleoecological sampling studies, previous studies have not revealed the fine-scale spatial and temporal variation in the composition of the Gatun fauna. High-resoluton faunal inventories were conducted from over 600 stratigraphic horizons in the Gatun Formation, capturing more than 200 species, which represent mostly widespread or common, and typically macroscopic taxa. Cluster and detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) reveal a stratigraphic pattern of variation in the faunal composition of individual horizons as well as differences between sampling sites. Stratigraphic curves of DCA axis scores indicate relative shifts in water depth and sedimentation through the stratigraphy and among localities. Overall the Gatun reveals both coarse- and fine-scale temporal variations in paleobathymetry, reflecting long-term shifts in basin subsidence and accommodation space that is potentially overprinted by fifth- or sixth-order glacio-eustatic cycles. The formation accumulated during an overall phase of increasing accommodation space, with major intervals of transgression (lower Gatun), regression (middle Gatun), and further transgression to mid-shelf depths (upper Gatun). Shallowing through the middle part of the Gatun is largely the result of an increase in supply of pyroclastic and volcaniclastic sediments from the adjacent volcanic arc. These findings have implications for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Canal Basin.},

De ninguna manera pensamos que es un texto definitivo; solo es una apretada s{\'{i}}ntesis de los trayectos que recorrimos, d{\'{o}}nde nos encontramos y d{\'{o}}nde creemos que podemos llegar. Nuestro relato transita por los caminos m{\'{a}}s firmes que conocemos. Por ello, nos referimos mayormente a nuestros propios trabajos, resumiendo las discusiones metodol{\'{o}}gicas, conceptuales y epistemol{\'{o}}gicas que se nos han ido planteando y se{\~{n}}alando alternativas. Nuestra perspectiva es que, desde la singularidad de las faunas extintas de vertebrados de Am{\'{e}}rica del Sur, los estudios funcionales ayudar{\'{a}}n a descifrar procesos a nivel de organismos que aportar{\'{a}}n a enfoques supraorgan{\'{i}}smicos (incluyendo el ambiental) en los an{\'{a}}lisis evolutivos (del pr{\'{o}}logo de los autores)},

abstract = {We investigate spatial and temporal patterns of diversification within the Neotropical avifauna using the phylogenetic history of parrots traditionally belonging to the genus Pionopsitta Bonaparte 1854. This genus has long been of interest for those studying Neotropical biogeography and diversity, as it encompasses species that occur in most Neotropical forest areas of endemism. Phylogenetic relationships were investigated for all species of the genus Pionopsitta and five other short-tailed parrot genera using complete sequences of the mitochondrial genes cyt b and ND2 as well as 26 plumage characters. The resulting phylogeny was used to test the monophyly of the genus, investigate species limits, and as a framework for reconstructing their historical biogeography and patterns of diversification. We found that the genus Pionopsitta, as previously defined, is not monophyletic and thus the Choco´ , Central American and Amazonian species will now have to be placed in the genus Gypopsitta. The molecular and morphological phylogenies are largely congruent, but disagree on the position of one of the Amazon basin taxa. Using molecular sequence data, we estimate that species within Gypopsitta diversified between 8.7 and 0.6 Ma, with the main divergences occurring between 3.3 and 6.4 Ma. These temporal results are compared to other taxa showing similar vicariance patterns. The results suggest that diversification in Gypopsitta was influenced mainly by geotectonic events, marine transgressions and river dynamics, whereas Quaternary glacial cycles of forest change seem to have played a minor role in the origination of the currently recognized species.},

abstract = {Triportheidae represents a relatively small family of characiform fishes with highly modified morphology. The relationship among characiform families is still unclear, and a phylogenetic analysis for the family including a representative number of Triportheus species has never been performed. Here, we inferred a phylogeny for 19 of the 22 species recognized for this family and two possible new Triportheus species using two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Our results show that (1) Triportheidae is monophyletic and a sister group of the clade consisting of the families Bryconidae and Gasteropelecidae; (2) Triportheus is monophyletic, but some species need to be reviewed and described; (3) all genera in Triportheidae, except for Agoniates originated in the period between Early Oligocene and Early Miocene and (4) speciation in Triportheidae coincides with important geological events in South America, reinforcing the importance of time-calibrated trees to study fish evolution.},

abstract = {Megalonychidae are known from the Deseadan of Argentina and Bolivia to the present, represented by the tree sloth Choloepus Illiger. The principal fossil records of this clade are those from the Quaternary of Central America and the Antilles (e.g., Megalocnus Leidy, Acratocnus Anthony) and North America (e.g., Megalonyx Harlan, Pliometanastes Hirschfeld and Webb). From the Quaternary of South America, Megalonychidae are recorded in Peru (Diabolotherium Pujos, De Iuliis, Argot and Werdelin) and Brazil (e.g., Ahytherium Cartelle, De Iuliis and Pujos, Australonyx De Iuliis, Pujos and Cartelle). In Argentina they also have been recorded in the Santa Cruz Formation (early-middle Miocene) on the coast of Santa Cruz Province (Eucholaeops Ameghino), Arroyo Chasico Formation (Protomegalonyx Kraglievich), Rio Negro Formation, in the ``conglomerado osifero{\{}''{\}} (ossiferous conglomerate) or ``Mesopotamiense{\{}''{\}} (late Miocene) at the base of Ituzaingo Formation, Entre Rios Province, and Pleistocene of Buenos Aires Province. Several authors have studied the Megalonychidae from the ``conglomerado osifero{\{}''{\}}, but no systematic revision of the group has been undertaken beyond the original naming of species. Taking into account that a broad range of individual variation has been observed in the Megalonychidae from the Pleistocene of North America and the West Indies, and that a similar range probably existed among the megalonychids from the ``conglomerado osifero{\{}''{\}}, then the number of valid species might be lower than previously proposed. Thus, the valid species recovered from the ``conglomerado osifero{\{}''{\}} are Ortotherium laticurvatum Ameghino, Phomorphus mutilatus Ameghino, Amphiocnus paranense Kraglievich, Protomegalonyx doellojuradoi Kraglievich, Pr. Praecursor Kraglievich, Megalonychops primigenius Kraglievich, and Paranabradys vucetichae Scillato-Yane. However, the establishment of synonymies, as well as the generic and specific assignation of the specimens is not an easy task, due to the peculiar taphonomical context of this stratigraphic unit.

abstract = {Fishes of the order Characiformes are a diverse and economically important teleost clade whose extant members are found exclusively in African and Neotropical freshwaters. Although their transatlantic distribution has been primarily attributed to the Early Cretaceous fragmentation of western Gondwana, vicariance has not been tested with temporal information beyond that contained in their fragmentary fossil record and a recent time-scaled phylogeny focused on the African family Alestidae. Because members of the suborder Citharinoidei constitute the sister lineage to the entire remaining Afro-Neotropical characiform radiation, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of citharinoids using a popular Bayesian approach to molecular dating in order to assess the adequacy of current vicariance hypotheses and shed light on the early biogeographic history of characiform fishes. Given that the only comprehensive phylogenetic treatment of the Citharinoidei has been a morphology-based analysis published over three decades ago, the present study also provided an opportunity to further investigate citharinoid relationships and update the evolutionary framework that has laid the foundations for the current classification of the group. The inferred chronogram is robust to changes in calibration priors and suggests that the origins of citharinoids date back to the Turonian (ca 90 Ma) of the Late Cretaceous. Most modern citharinoid genera, however, appear to have originated and diversified much more recently, mainly during the Miocene. By reconciling molecular-clock- with fossil-based estimates for the origins of the Characiformes, our results provide further support for the hypothesis that attributes the disjunct distribution of the order to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. The striking overlap in tempo of diversification and biogeographic patterns between citharinoids and the African-endemic family Alestidae suggests that their evolutionary histories could have been strongly and similarly influenced by Miocene geotectonic events that modified the landscape and produced the drainage pattern of Central Africa seen today.},

abstract = {Molecular clock methodology provides the best means of establishing evolutionary timescales, the accuracy and precision of which remain reliant on calibration, traditionally based on fossil constraints on clade (node) ages. Tip calibration has been developed to obviate undesirable aspects of node calibration, including the need for maximum age constraints that are invariably very difficult to justify. Instead, tip calibration incorporates fossil species as dated tips alongside living relatives, potentially improving the accuracy and precision of divergence time estimates. We demonstrate that tip calibration yields node calibrations that violate fossil evidence, contributing to unjustifiably young and ancient age estimates, less precise and (presumably) accurate than conventional node calibration. However, we go on to show that node and tip calibrations are complementary, producing meaningful age estimates, with node minima enforcing realistic ages and fossil tips interacting with node calibrations to objectively define maximum age constraints on clade ages. Together, tip and node calibrations may yield evolutionary timescales that are better justified, more precise and accurate than either calibration strategy can achieve alone.},

abstract = {The Venezuelan Andes are an asymmetric, doubly vergent orogen that is flanked on its southeastern side by the Barinas basin. Analyses of sedimentary facies, sandstone petrography, apatite fission-tracks, and magnetostratigraphy were completed on a 1750-m section of the syn-orogenic Neogene Par{\'{a}}ngula and R{\'{i}}o Yuca formations in the Barinas side foothills of the Venezuelan Andes. Our sedimentary facies analyses record a progression of sedimentary environments from floodplain and floodplain channel deposits through the 560-m thick Par{\'{a}}ngula Formation transitioning to distal alluvial fan deposits in the lower R{\'{i}}o Yuca Formation and finally to an alternation of distal alluvial fan and two, ∼100-m thick organic-rich lacustrine deposits in the upper third of the section. Major- and minor-mineral petrographic analysis reveals unroofing of the Venezuelan Andes, with quartz arenite composition low in the section succeeded by metamorphic and igneous clasts and potassium feldspar appearing near the base of the R{\'{i}}o Yuca Formation. Apatite fission-track (AFT) analysis of sandstones and pebbles generated ages of 11.2 ± 1.3 - 13.8 ± 2.0 Ma over ∼1100 m of stratigraphic section. Thermal modeling of the detrital AFT and vitrinite data from the lower R{\'{i}}o Yuca Formation indicates exhumation of the source area was occurring by 12-13 Ma, surface exposure at 10-9 Ma, maximum burial by 4-2 Ma and exhumation of the sedimentary package starting 3-2 Ma. Accumulation of the R{\'{i}}o Yuca Formation is contemporaneous with a basinward migration of the deformation front. Regional considerations indicate that the Venezuelan Andes evolved from a primarily singly vergent orogen to its current double vergence over the interval of Neogene-Quaternary sedimentation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Based on additional specimens the fossil pimelodid catfish from the upper Miocene Urumaco Formation, Falc{\'{o}}n State, Venezuela originally assigned to the extant species Phractocephalus hemioliopterus is described as a new, extinct species. Phractocephalus nassi n. sp. is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: 1) posterior half of frontals and anterior half of supraoccipital with elongate, coarse ridges and sulci in addition to reticulating ridges and subcircular pits; 2) very broad and ornamented mesethmoid bone; 3) lateral ethmoid margin convex and eliminating orbital notch but not projecting far anteriorly over palatine condyle; 4) anterior cranial fontanelle closed or represented by a small pit; 5) supraoccipital process rounded laterally and posterolaterally, concave posteriorly and completely concealing Weberian complex in dorsal view; 6) opercle covered with reticulating ridges and pits; 7) cleithrum coarsely ornamented along ventral edge and bulging outward lateral to spine articulation; 8) pectoral spine mostly ornamented with coarse ridges and sulci. Phractocephalus nassi is compared to modern P. hemioliopterus and an undescribed extinct species from the upper Miocene Solim{\~{o}}es Formation, Acre, Brazil. New diagnostic characters of Phractocephalus are presented that apply to the modern and fossil species, including: 1) ornamentation of skull, pectoral girdle and fin spines comprising a coarse meshwork of reticulating ridges surrounding rounded pits plus some elongate ridges and sulci; 2) supraoccipital posterior process greatly expanded laterally and posteriorly behind occipital wall; 3) lateral ethmoid and sphenotic broadly sutured behind eye; 4) anterior cranial fontanelle reduced or completely closed and posterior cranial fontanelle closed; 5) vomerine tooth plate large, roughly pentagonal to triangular in form, and with fine teeth. Today Phractocephalus ranges widely throughout the lowland Orinoco, Amazon and Essequibo basins. However, the genus does not occur west or north of the Andes or Venezuelan coastal ranges. Recognizing the Urumaco Phractocephalus as a distinct species does not alter the obvious conclusion that this catfish marks a large river connection between the Caribbean coastal region and the Orinoco system during at least part of the Neogene. Other Urumaco fossils show this same biogeographic relationship.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Characiformes is an order of freshwater fishes that includes many commercially important and emblematic species from South America and Africa, such as the popular piranhas, hatchetfishes, African tiger fishes and tetras. The order is split into two suborders with a total of 24 families, 282 genera and ca. 2,100 species. Here, we present an expanded phylogeny of characiform fishes, including data for 520 species and three genes (12S, 16S and RAG1), and the recently described family Tarumaniidae, which has not been examined by previous molecular analysis. Although our genetic coverage is limited to three gene fragments, the tree inferred based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference supports the monophyly of all characiform families and is largely congruent with results from recent studies that sampled less taxa but more genes. Also in agreement with a morphological hypothesis, our results strongly support the sister-group relationships between the family Tarumaniidae and Erythrinidae. Based on our results and that of the other molecular analyses, we propose a revised circumscription of the superfamily Erythrinoidea to include the families Tarumaniidae and Erythrinidae only.RESUMEN Characiformes es un orden de peces de agua dulce que incluye un gran numero de especies emblem{\'{a}}ticas y de importancia comercial en Sur Am{\'{e}}rica y {\'{A}}frica como lo son las populares pira{\~{n}}as, los peces voladores, los peces tigre de {\'{A}}frica y los tetras.

abstract = {The extraordinary contemporary species richness and ecological predominance of flowering plants (angiosperms) are even more remarkable when considering the relatively recent onset of their evolutionary diversification. We examine the evolutionary diversification of angiosperms and the observed differential distribution of species in angiosperm clades by estimating the rate of diversification for angiosperms as a whole and for a large set of angiosperm clades. We also identify angiosperm clades with a standing diversity that is either much higher or lower than expected, given the estimated background diversification rate. Recognition of angiosperm clades, the phylogenetic relationships among them, and their taxonomic composition are based on an empirical compilation of primary phylogenetic studies. By making an integrative and critical use of the paleobotanical record, we obtain reasonably secure approximations for the age of a large set of angiosperm clades. Diversification was modeled as a stochastic, time-homogeneous birth-and-death process that depends on the diversification rate (r) and the relative extinction rate ($\epsilon$). A statistical analysis of the birth and death process was then used to obtain 95{\%} confidence intervals for the expected number of species through time in a clade that diversifies at a rate equal to that of angiosperms as a whole. Confidence intervals were obtained for stem group and for crown group ages in the absence of extinction ($\epsilon$ = 0.0) and under a high relative extinction rate ($\epsilon$ = 0.9). The standing diversity of angiosperm clades was then compared to expected species diversity according to the background rate of diversification, and, depending on their placement with respect to the calculated confidence intervals, exceedingly species-rich or exceedingly species-poor clades were identified. The rate of diversification for angiosperms as a whole ranges from 0.077 ($\epsilon$ = 0.9) to 0.089 ($\epsilon$ = 0.0) net speciation events per million years. Ten clades fall above the confidence intervals of expected species diversity, and 13 clades were found to be unexpectedly species poor. The phylogenetic distribution of clades with an exceedingly high number of species suggests that traits that confer high rates of diversification evolved independently in different instances and do not characterize the angiosperms as a whole.},

abstract = {Previous studies based on DNA sequences of mitochondrial (mt) rRNA genes showed three main groups within the subfamily Serrasalminae: (1) a "pacu" clade of herbivores (Colossoma, Mylossoma, Piaractus); (2) the Wyleus clade (Myleus, Mylesinus, Tometes, Ossubtus); and (3) the "piranha" clacle (Serrasalmus, Pygocentrus, Pygopristis, Pristobtycon, Catoprion, Metynnis). The genus Acnodon was placed as the sister taxon of clade (2+3). However, poor resolution within each clacle was obtained due to low levels of variation among rRNA gene sequences. Complete sequences of the hypervariable mtDNA control region for a total of 45 taxa, and additional sequences of 12S and 16S rRNA from a total of 74 taxa representing all genera in the family are now presented to address intragroup relationships. Control region sequences of several serrasalmid species exhibit tandem repeats of short motifs (12 to 33 bp) in the 3' end of this region, accounting for substantial length variation. Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony analyses of these sequences identify the same groupings as before and provide further evidence to support the following observations: (a) Serrasalmus gouldingi and species of Pristobrycon (non-striolatus) form a monophyletic group that is the sister group to other species of Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus; (b) Catoprion, Pygopristis, and Pristobrycon striolatus form a well supported clacle, sister to the group described above; (c) some taxa assigned to the genus Myloplus (M. asterias, M tiete, M temetzi, and M rubripinnis) form a well supported group whereas other Myloplus species remain with uncertain affinities (d) Mylesinus, Tometes and Myleus setiger form a monophyletic group.},

abstract = {Graphical displays were used early in geophysics and crystallography, mineralogy, petrology and structural geology by the early 1800s, but nineteenth-century geology obstinately remained mainly descriptive. Charles Lyell's quantitative classification of the Tertiary Sub-Era in 1828 was a notable exception. Nevertheless, by 1920 the quantitative approach had become established. W. C. Krumbein, who introduced the computer into geology in 1958, encouraged use of probabilistic sampling and process-response models. Early work focused on databases, statistical data analysis and display. By the 1970s, stochastic simulation, deterministic modelling and spatial 'geostatistics' (pioneered by Matheron and his co-workers), were of growing importance. The introduction of the personal computer and the graphical user interface in the 1980s brought well-proven quantitative methods out of the research environment onto the workbench and into the field. Since the mid-1980s, the analysis, display and modelling of behaviour in the three dimensions, underpinned by spatial statistics, computational fluid-flow, visualization technology, etc., has proved of economic benefit to mining, petroleum geology and hydrogeology. Other, computationally intensive, methods likely to be of importance in the Earth sciences are the application of 'robust' statistical methods, increasing use of Bayesian methods in uncertainty (risk) estimation (as a result of a renewed interest in statistical intervals and forecasting), and computational mineralogy.},

abstract = {The uplift of the Andes was a major factor for plant diversification in South America and had significant effects on the climatic patterns at the continental scale. It was crucial for the formation of the arid environments in south-eastern and western South America. However, both the timing of the major stages of the Andean uplift and the onset of aridity in western South America remain controversial. In this paper we examine the hypothesis that the Andean South American groups of Heliotropium originated and diversified in response to Andean orogeny during the late Miocene and a the subsequent development of aridity. To this end, we estimate divergence times and likely biogeographical origins of the major clades in the phylogeny of Heliotropium, using both Bayesian and likelihood methods. Divergence times of all Andean clades in Heliotropium are estimated to be of late Miocene or Pliocene ages. At least three independent Andean diversification events can be recognized within Heliotropium. Timing of the diversification in the Andean lineages Heliotropium sects.Heliothamnus, Cochranea, Heliotrophytum, Hypsogenia, Plagiomeris, Platygyne clearly correspond to a rapid, late Miocene uplift of the Andes and a Pliocene development of arid environments in South America. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The bony-tongue fish genus Arapaima M{\"{u}}ller has been considered monotypic since 1868, with A. gigas being the only recognized species. Review of species-level taxonomy of Arapaima has revealed that Arapaima agassizii Valenciennes (in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1847) should be considered a valid species. The holotype was destroyed in World War II, but the species can be recognized based on the original description, which included detailed osteological illustrations. At least nine characters distinguish it from all other Arapaima: 1) dentary teeth 44 (counted on one ramus only, vs. 21-37 in other Arapaima); 2) maxillary teeth 43 (vs. 21-38 in other Arapaima); 3) orbit diameter 1.5{\%} standard length (SL, vs. 1.5-2.8, relatively larger in all other Arapaima at similar SL); 4) interorbital width 4.1{\%} SL (vs. 5.3-6.5 in other Arapaima); 5) parietals with pronounced posterior projections that are pointed and curve slightly toward midline (vs. absent in other Arapaima); 6) caudal fin widely separated from dorsal and anal fins by long caudal peduncle, 9.7{\%} SL (vs. much shorter peduncle, 3.2-5.5 in others); 7) anal fin with only 26 rays (vs. 30-40 in others), with distinctly shorter basal length than dorsal-fin base; 8) dorsal and anal fins extremely low in profile; dorsal-fin base divided by longest dorsal ray about 7 (vs. 3.1-5.5 in others); and 9) first pectoral-fin ray with proximal tip similar in form to subsequent pectoral-fin rays (vs. first pectoral-fin ray noticeably enlarged relative to subsequent rays). Arapaima agassizii still is known only from the holotype, which was collected in 1817-20 somewhere in lowlands of the Brazilian Amazon. It thus is important to locate this taxon to determine its distribution and conservation status. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.},

abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

In fossils, teeth found in the oral cavity are usually linked with jaws, although mineralised structures with the same histology as teeth are known in fossils before jaws appeared. Denticles in the skin occur in both fossil and extant fish. Pharyngeal denticles also occur in both extant and fossil gnathostomes but in only a few fossil agnathans (thelodonts). Complex structures with dentine and enamel have been described in the earliest jawless vertebrates, conodonts. Such fossils have been used to suggest that teeth and jaws have evolved and developed independently. Our understanding of the developmental biology of mammalian tooth development has increased greatly in the last few years to a point where we now understand some of the basic genetic interactions controlling tooth initiation, morphogenesis and patterning. The aim of this review is to see what this developmental information can reveal about evolution of the dentition.},

abstract = {Aim: To investigate the role of historical processes in the evolution of the spot-backed antbird species complex Hylophylax naevius/Hylophylax naevioides (Aves, Thamnophilidae). Location: Throughout the Amazon Basin and across the Andes in Central and northern South America. Methods: We investigated the evolutionary history of the H. naevius/H. naevioides complex based on a total of 100 individuals from opposite banks of the major Amazonian rivers and both sides of the Andes. Nucleotide sequences from two mitochondrial DNA genes [1015 bp of cytochrome b (cyt b) and 1023 bp of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2)] and one nuclear marker [539 bp of intron 5 of the $\beta$-fibrinogen (BF5)] were obtained. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. We used Bayesian coalescent-based approaches to evaluate demographic changes through time, and to estimate the timing of the diversification events. Results: Well-supported allopatric and parapatric lineages were recovered within the H. naevius/H. naevioides complex, with high levels of genetic differentiation, both on opposite sides of rivers (0.6-7.1{\%}) and across the Andes (6.9{\%}). Molecular dating and population demography suggest cladogenesis in various periods, associated with distinct vicariance and dispersal events. Main conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that the uplift of the northern Andes and the consolidation of the modern Amazon drainage system were key to promoting the diversification of forest-dwelling bird lineages in the northern Neotropics. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

The marine resource groups included are bivalves, gastropods, chitons, cephalopods, stomatopods, shrimps, lobsters, crabs, hagfishes, sharks, batoid fishes, chimaeras, bony fishes and sea turtles. The introductory chapter outlines the environmental, ecological, and biogeographical factors influencing the marine biota, and the basic components of the fisheries in the Eastern Central Atlantic. Within the field guide, the sections on the resource groups are arranged phylogenetically according to higher taxonomic levels such as class, order, and family. Each resource group is introduced by general remarks on the group, an illustrated section on technical terms and measurements, and a key or guide to orders or families. Each family generally has an account summarizing family diagnostic characters, biological and fisheries information, notes on similar families occurring in the area, a key to species, a checklist of species, and a short list of relevant literature. Families that are less important to fisheries include an abbreviated family account and no detailed species information. Species in the important families are treated in detail (arranged alphabetically by genus and species) and include the species name, frequent synonyms and names of similar species, an illustration, FAO common name(s), diagnostic characters, biology and fisheries information, notes on geographical distribution, and a distribution map. For less important species, abbreviated accounts are used. Generally this includes the species name, FAO common name(s), an illustration, a distribution map, and notes on biology, fisheries, and distribution.

Weckstein (2005) reported on the phylogenetic history of this genus based on three mitochondrial genes, but some relationships were weakly supported and one of the subspecies of R. vitellinus (citreolaemus) was unsampled. This study expands on Weckstein (2005) by adding more DNA sequence data (including a nuclear marker) and more samples, including R. v. citreolaemus. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods recovered similar trees, with nodes showing high support. A monophyletic R. vitellinus complex was strongly supported as the sister-group to R. brevis. The results also confirmed that the southeastern and northern populations of R. vitellinus ariel are paraphyletic. R. v. citreolaemus is sister to the Amazonian subspecies of the vitellinus complex. Using three protein-coding genes (COI, cytochrome-b and ND2) and interval-calibrated nodes under a Bayesian relaxed-clock framework, we infer that ramphastid genera originated in the middle Miocene to early Pliocene, Ramphastos species originated between late Miocene and early Pleistocene, and intra-specific divergences took place throughout the Pleistocene. Parsimony-based reconstruction of ancestral areas indicated that evolution of the four trans-Andean Ramphastos taxa (R. v. citreolaemus, R. a. swainsonii, R. brevis and R. sulfuratus) was associated with four independent dispersals from the cis-Andean region. The last pulse of Andean uplift may have been important for the evolution of R. sulfuratus, whereas the origin of the other trans-Andean Ramphastos taxa is consistent with vicariance due to drying events in the lowland forests north of the Andes. Estimated rates of molecular evolution were higher than the "standard" bird rate of 2{\%} substitutions/site/million years for two of the three genes analyzed (cytochrome-b and ND2). ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The world-famous "Pesciara di Bolca" Fossil-Lagerst{\"{a}}tte has been examined in its palaeontological and sedimentological aspects. A re-examination of the co-occurring age-diagnostic larger foraminifers (Alveolina and Nummulites) indicates a SBZ 11 (late Ypresian) age. Sedimentological characters allowed us to distinguish between autochthonous micritic limestones and allochthonous biocalcarenites-biocalcirudites; the latter are the product of penecontemporaneous transport from nearby areas. The depositional model here proposed involves a basin with restricted circulation and a prevailing micrite sedimentation. This basin was affected by relative sea-level oscillations and coarser grained storm-induced deposition. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction suggests neighbouring emerged land and very shallow sea bottoms inhabited by large foraminifers such as Alveolina and Nummulites. As yet, it is unclear whether a true coral reef was present nearby. The bottom on which the Pesciara deposits accumulated is interpreted as poorly oxygenated, possibly with stromatolite-like bacterial mats, thus allowing the exceptional preservation of the fish and plants. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The eastern Brazilian coastal drainages are of great biogeographical significance, because of their highly endemic fish faunas. Phylogenetic patterns suggest a close biotic relationship between the rivers that flow into the Atlantic and those on the adjacent upland crystalline shield. However, little has been said on the dynamics of the geological processes causally related to the cladogenetic events between these areas. Distributional and phylogenetic patterns suggest a close association with the geological history of the passive continental margin of South America, from the Cretaceous to the present day. In this area megadome uplifts, rifting, vertical movements between rifted blocks and the erosive retreat of the South American eastern continental margin are hypothesized as the main geological forces controlling the distribution of freshwater fishes. The tectonic activity associated with the break-up of Gondwana and separation of South America and Africa formed six megadomes that control most of the current courses of the main crystalline shield river basins. Except for basins located at the edges of such megadomes, these river systems developed long, circuitous routes over the ancient Brazilian crystalline shield before emptying into the recently opened Atlantic Ocean. Initial cladogenetic events between upland crystalline drainages and Atlantic tributaries were probably associated with vicariant processes, and some ancient basal sister-groups of widespread inclusive taxa are found in these coastal hydrographic systems. Later, generalized erosive denudation resulted in an isostatic adjustment of the eastern margin of the platform. These, along with reactivations of ancient rifts led to vertical movements between rifted blocks and gave rise, in southeastern Brazil, to taphrogenic (rift related) basins. These basins, such as the Taubate, Sao Paulo, Curitiba and Volta Redonda basins, among others, captured adjacent upland drainages and fauna. The fossil fishes from the Tremembe Formation (Eocene-Oligocene of Taubate Basin) exemplify this process. Other taphrogenic systems of Tertiary age were also identified in other segments of the Atlantic continental margin, such as in Borborema province, in NE Brazil, with marked influence over drainage patterns. At the same time, erosive retreat of the eastern margin of the platform successively captured upland rivers, which became Atlantic tributaries evolving associated to main rift systems. The continued nature of these processes explains the mixed phylogenetic and distributional patterns between Atlantic tributaries and the upland crystalline shield areas, especially in the southeastern continental margin, represented by successively, less inclusive sister-groups associated with cladogenetic events from the Late Cretaceous to the present.},

R8s version 1.5 is a program which uses parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric methods to relax the assumption of constant rates of evolution to obtain better estimates of rates and times. Unlike most programs for rate inference or phylogenetics, r8s permits users to convert results to absolute rates and ages by constraining one or more node times to be fixed, minimum or maximum ages (using fossil or other evidence). Version 1.5 uses truncated Newton nonlinear optimization code with bound constraints, offering superior performance over previous versions.

The fauna of this region is shaped not only by the geology of the area but climatic events as well. The Rupununi district of southwestern Guyana is an area where seasonal rainfall floods a vast savanna. During the rainy season, this inundated savanna allows a connection between the Amazon and Essequibo Rivers that provides the potential for ichthyofaunal exchange. The connection is referred to as the Rupununi portal and this study investigates how this feature influences fish distributions and diversity between the drainages it links. In this study, fishes on either side of the portal were extensively sampled. Statistical comparisons of fish community structure from the two sides of the Rupununi portal were made using three common metrics: species richness, Shannon diversity and evenness. Significant community differences were found between the Essequibo and Amazon sides of the Rupununi portal. While the Rupununi portal serves as a conduit for some fish, it appears to be functioning as a barrier to dispersal for other species. Our study highlights the significance of the Rupununi portal in shaping fish distributions in this region.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the taxonomic assembly of montane biotas are still poorly understood. Most hypotheses have assumed that the diversification of montane biotas is loosely coupled to Earth history and have emphasized instead the importance of multiple long-distance dispersal events and biotic interactions, particularly competition, for structuring the taxonomic composition and distribution of montane biotic elements. Here we use phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of species in the parrot genus Pionus to demonstrate that standing diversity within montane lineages is directly attributable to events of Earth history. Phylogenetic relationships confirm three independent biogeographic disjunctions between montane lineages, on one hand, and lowland dry-forest/wet-forest lineages on the other. Temporal estimates of lineage diversification are consistent with the interpretation that the three lineages were transported passively to high elevations by mountain building, and that subsequent diversification within the Andes was driven primarily by Pleistocene climatic oscillations and their large-scale effects on habitat change. These results support a mechanistic link between diversification and Earth history and have general implications for explaining high altitudinal disjuncts and the origin of montane biotas.},

abstract = {We take advantage of the broad distribution of howler monkeys from Mexico to Argentina to provide a historical biogeographical analysis on a regional scale that encompasses the entire Neotropics. The phylogenetic relationships among 9 of the 10 recognized Alouatta species were inferred using three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. The nuclear gene regions provided no phylogenetic resolution among howler monkey species, and were characterized by very low levels of sequence divergence between Alouatta and the Ateles outgroup. The mtDNA genes, on the other hand, produced a well-resolved phylogeny, which indicated that the earliest split among howler monkeys separated cis- and trans-Andean clades. Eight monophyletic mtDNA haplotype clades were identified, representing six named species in South America, including Alouatta seniculus, Alouatta sara, Alouatta macconelli, Alouatta caraya, Alouatta belzebul, and Alouatta guariba, and two in Mesoamerica, Alouatta pigra and Alouatta palliata. Molecular clock-based estimates of branching times indicated that contemporary howler monkey species originated in the late Miocene and Pliocene, not the Pleistocene. The causes of Alouatta diversification were more difficult to pin down, although we posit that the initial cis-, trans-Andean split in the genus was caused by the late Miocene completion of the northern Andes. Riverine barriers to dispersal and putative forest refuges can neither be discounted nor distinguished as causes of speciation in many cases, and one, the other or both have likely played a role in the diversification of South American howler monkeys. Finally, we estimated the separation of Mesoamerican A. pigra and A. palliata at 3 Ma, which corresponds to the completion date of the Panama Isthmus promoting a role for this earth history event in the speciation of Central American howler monkeys. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Significant shortening and crustal thickening have contributed to the construction of the present topography and elevation. In this contribution, we combine the use of teleseismic receiver functions, Hf isotopes, whole-rock geochemistry, and U-Pb dating to help elucidate the main mechanisms that played a role in the crustal thickening and uplift of the cordillera. Receiver functions calculated for three stations on top of the plateau are consistent with the presence of thrusts that converge into major crustal interfaces at upper-middle crustal depths; they also suggest the existence of two crustal anisotropic layers beneath the western flank of the cordillera, which we interpret to have formed as a result of shearing. In the northern portion of the plateau, in the area where two Mio-Pliocene volcanic domes and their related deposits outcrop, a lower crustal high seismic velocity layer is suggested by the receiver functions; we propose magmatic underplating for the origin of this layer. The geochemical characteristics of the volcanic rocks in the area are consistent with partial melt in a mantle influenced by slab-related fluids; this magma could have been added to the crust and portions of it ascended and reached the surface, experiencing assimilation and differentiation during the process. We hypothesize that this Mio-Pliocene volcanism was related to flattening of the Nazca subducting slab.},

abstract = {The catfish (Siluroidei) appear to have evolved from an ancestor which, in most respects other than the form of its teeth, resembled primitive Characinoidei. In the first part of this paper it is shown that most of the numerous and profound anatomical changes which have occurred in the course of their evolution from this ancestor can be related to one or other of three basic changes: depression of the body in adaptation to bottom-feeding habits, sensory modification in adaptation to nocturnal habits, and the evolution of defensive fin spines. Diplomystes is more primitive than other known catfish in the form of its maxilla and pectoral girdle, and in the posterior position of its dorsal fin. The second part of the paper is concerned with some of the more specialized families of catfish (Mochokidae, Siluridae, Schilbeidae, Malapteruridae, Clariidae, Callichthyidae and Loricariidae). The specializations in each case are described, and related to the habits of the fish.},

abstract = {Flatfish cranial asymmetry represents one of the most remarkable morphological innovations among vertebrates, and has fueled vigorous debate on the manner and rate at which strikingly divergent phenotypes evolve. A surprising result of many recent molecular phylogenetic studies is the lack of support for flatfish monophyly, where increasingly larger DNA datasets of up to 23 loci have either yielded a weakly supported flatfish clade or indicated the group is polyphyletic. Lack of resolution for flatfish relationships has been attributed to analytical limitations for dealing with processes such as nucleotide non-stationarity and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). We tackle this phylogenetic problem using a sequence dataset comprising more than 1,000 ultraconserved DNA element (UCE) loci covering 45 carangimorphs, the broader clade containing flatfishes and several other specialized lineages such as remoras, billfishes, and archerfishes. We present a phylogeny based on UCE loci that unequivocally supports flatfish monophyly and a single origin of asymmetry. We document similar levels of discordance among UCE loci as in previous, smaller molecular datasets. However, relationships among flatfishes and carangimorphs recovered from multilocus concatenated and species tree analyses of our data are robust to the analytical framework applied and size of data matrix used. By integrating the UCE data with a rich fossil record, we find that the most distinctive carangimorph bodyplans arose rapidly during the Paleogene (66.0–23.03 Ma). Flatfish asymmetry, for example, likely evolved over an interval of no more than 2.97 million years. The longstanding uncertainty in phylogenetic hypotheses for flatfishes and their carangimorph relatives highlights the limitations of smaller molecular datasets when applied to successive, rapid divergences. Here, we recovered significant support for flatfish monophyly and relationships among carangimorphs through analysis of over 1,000 UCE loci. The resulting time-calibrated phylogeny points to phenotypic divergence early within carangimorph history that broadly matches with the predictions of adaptive models of lineage diversification.},

abstract = {Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data, most commonly fossil age estimates, are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence-time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the 'fossilized birth-death' (FBD) process, a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and show that node-age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We then used this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus Ursus diversified in the late Miocene to mid Pliocene.},

abstract = {A comprehensive phylogeny of species relationships of the Auchenipteridae is reconstructed here with a large-scale taxon sampling based on combined morphological and molecular datasets. The hypothesized phylogeny includes most species of Auchenipteridae (97 of 124 valid species) and multiple members of siluriform families as an outgroup (32 species) to embrace the diversity of forms among related catfishes. As the first large-scale phylogeny of the Auchenipteridae, comparison between taxa included information from both morphology (264 characters) and mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers (3490 nucleotides) from five genes: coI, 16S, rag2, myh6 and SH3PX3. Trees were generated under two different optimality criteria (Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference). A new classification for the family is presented herein to bring the taxonomy more in line with the new phylogenetic hypothesis. The strict consensus tree corroborates the monophyly of superfamily Doradoidea, family Auchenipteridae and its two subfamilies, Centromochlinae and Auchenipterinae. The new classification scheme proposes nine tribes in Auchenipteridae, based on the monophyly of major groups in both subfamilies. Centromochlus, Glanidium and Tatia are each recovered as paraphyletic. To maintain a monophyletic classification, some species treated as Tatia and Centromochlus are assigned to genera not previously recognized as valid.},

abstract = {There is as yet no general agreement regarding the most appropriate solution to the problem of identifying areas of endemism, not even in particular cases. In this study, we compared Endemicity Analysis (EA), Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE), and Biotic Elements Analysis (BE) based on their ability to identify hypothetical predefined patterns that represent nested, overlapping, and disjoint areas of endemism supported by species with different degrees of sympatry. We found that PAE performs poorly when applied to patterns that either overlap with each other or are supported by species with imperfect sympatry. BE exhibits a counterintuitive sensitivity to the degree of congruence among the distributions of endemic species, being unable to recognize areas of endemism supported by perfectly sympatric species. In contrast, in all cases examined we found that EA results in a high proportion of correctly identified distributional patterns. In addition to highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches, our results show how different methods can lead to seemingly conflicting conclusions and caution about the possibility of identifying distributional patterns that are merely methodological artefacts.},

Prochilodontids often form massive populations and many species achieve substantial body sizes; a combination that makes them one of the most commercially important fish groups on the continent. Their economic significance notwithstanding, prochilodontids have never been the subject of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis. Using three mitochondrial and three nuclear loci spanning all prochilodontid species, we generated a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for the family. Our results strongly support monophyly of the family and the three included genera. A novel, highly supported placement of Ichthyoelephas sister to the clade containing Prochilodus and Semaprochilodus diverges from a previous morphological hypothesis. Most previously hypothesized interspecific relationships are corroborated and some longstanding polytomies within Prochilodus and Semaprochilodus are resolved. The morphologically similar P. brevis, P. lacustris, P. nigricans and P. rubrotaeniatus are embedded within what is herein designated as the P. nigricans group. Species limits and distributions of these species are problematic and the group clearly merits taxonomic revision.},

abstract = {Tooth replacement poses many questions about development, pattern formation, tooth attachment mechanisms, functional morphology and the evolution of vertebrate dentitions. Although most vertebrate species have polyphyodont dentitions, detailed knowledge of tooth structure and replacement is poor for most groups, particularly actinopterygians. We examined the oral dentition of the bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, a pelagic and coastal marine predator, using a sample of 50 individuals. The oral teeth are located on the dentary and premaxillary bones, and we scored each tooth locus in the dentary and premaxillary bones using a four-part functional classification: absent (A), incoming (I), functional (F=fully ankylosed) or eroding (E). The homodont oral teeth of Pomatomus are sharp, deeply socketed and firmly ankylosed to the bone of attachment. Replacement is intraosseus and occurs in alternate tooth loci with long waves of replacement passing from rear to front. The much higher percentage of functional as opposed to eroding teeth suggests that replacement rates are low but that individual teeth are quickly lost once erosion begins. Tooth number increases ontogenetically, ranging from 15-31 dentary teeth and 15-39 premaxillary teeth in the sample studied. Teeth increase in size with every replacement cycle. Remodeling of the attachment bone occurs continuously to accommodate growth. New tooth germs originate from a discontinuous dental lamina and migrate from the lingual (dentary) or labial (premaxillary) epithelium through pores in the bone of attachment into the resorption spaces beneath the existing teeth. Pomatomus shares unique aspects of tooth replacement with barracudas and other scombroids and this supports the interpretation that Pomatomus is more closely related to scombroids than to carangoids. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Apparent variation in rates of origination and extinction reflects the true temporal pat- tern of taxonomic rates as well as the distorting effects of incomplete and variable preservation, effects that are themselves exacerbated by true variation in taxonomic rates. Here I present an ap- proach that can undo these distortions and thus permit estimates of true taxonomic rates, while providing estimates of preservation in the process. Standard survivorship probabilities are mod- ified to incorporate variable taxonomic rates and rates of fossil recovery. Time series of these rates are explored by numerical optimization until the set of rates that best explains the observed data is found. If internal occurrences within stratigraphic ranges are available, or if temporal patterns of fossil recovery can otherwise be assumed, these constraints can be exploited, but they are by no means necessary. In its most general form, the approach requires no data other than first and last appearances. When tested against simulated data, the method is able to recover temporal patterns in rates of origination, extinction, and preservation. With empirical data, it yields estimates of pres- ervation rate that agree with those obtained independently by tabulating internal occurrences with- in stratigraphic ranges. Moreover, when empirical occurrence data are artificially degraded, the method detects the resulting gaps in sampling and corrects taxonomic rates. Preliminary appli- cation to data on Paleozoic marine animals suggests that some features of the apparent record, such as the forward smearing of true origination events and the backward smearing of true extinction events, can be detected and corrected. Other features, such as the end-Ordovician extinction, may be fairly accurate at face value.},

Thus, the areas with the maximum number of species considered endemic are preferred. This is the first method for the identification of areas of endemism that implements an optimality criterion directly based on considering the aspects of species distribution that are relevant to endemism. The method is implemented in two computer programs, NDM and VNDM, available from the authors.},

abstract = {Since 65 million years ago (Ma), Earth's climate has undergone a significant and complex evolution, the finer details of which are now coming to light through investigations of deep-sea sediment cores. This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 10(5) to 10(7) years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 10(4)- to 10(6)-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 10(3) to 10(5) years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.},

Species of Acestrorhynchus comprise small-to-medium sized piscivorous fishes and have been traditionally grouped on the basis of well-defined color patterns. A recent phylogeny, based on morphological characters, could not resolve the phylogenetic affinities of A. heterolepis and the relationships among the species of the clade formed by A. abbreviatus, A. altus, A. falcatus, A. lacustris, and A. pantaneiro. The simultaneous analysis of two mitochondrial genes (16S and ATP synthase subunits 6 and 8) and one nuclear intron (S7) was able to resolve the latter clade, but the position of A. heterolepis remained unresolved. The combination of the molecular and morphological data sets in a total evidence analysis resulted in a well-resolved hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic relationships of Acestrorhynchus species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {On the basis of paleontological content (vertebrates and palynology) and facies analysis from river banks, road cuts, and three wells, we have assigned the uppermost levels of the Solim{\~{o}}es Formation in western Amazonia, Brazil, to the Late Miocene. The vertebrate fossil record from outcropping sediments is assigned to the Huayquerian-Mesopotamian mammalian biozones, spanning 9-6.5. Ma. Additionally, we present results that demonstrate that deposits in Peruvian Amazonia attributed to Miocene tidal environments are actually fluvial sediments that have been misinterpreted (both environmentally and chronologically) by several authors.The entire Late Miocene sequence was deposited in a continental environment within a subsiding basin. The facies analysis, fossil fauna content, and palynological record indicate that the environment of deposition was dominated by avulsive rivers associated with megafan systems, and avulsive rivers in flood basins (swamps, lakes, internal deltas, and splays). Soils developed on the flatter, drier areas, which were dominated by grasslands and gallery forest in a tropical to subtropical climate.These Late Miocene sediments were deposited from westward of the Purus arch up to the border of Brazil with Peru (Divisor Ranges) and Bolivia (Pando block). Eastward of the Iquitos structural high, however, more detailed studies, including vertebrate paleontology, need to be performed to calibrate with more precision the ages of the uppermost levels of the Solim{\~{o}}es Formation.The evolution of the basin during the late Miocene is mainly related to the tectonic behavior of the Central Andes ({\~{}}3°-15°S). At approximately 5. Ma, a segment of low angle of subduction was well developed in the Nazca Plate, and the deformation in the Subandean foreland produced the inland reactivation of the Divisor/Contamana Ranges and tectonic arrangements in the Eastern Andes. During the Pliocene southwestern Brazilian Amazonia ceased to be an effective sedimentary basin, and became instead an erosional area that contributed sediments to the Amazon fluvial system. At that time, the lowland fluvial systems of southwestern Amazonia (the Purus, Jurua and Javar{\'{i}} basins) become isolated from the Andes by the newly formed north-flowing Ucayali system and south-east flowing Madre de Dios System. It was during the early Pliocene that the Amazon fluvial system integrated regionally and acquired its present appearance, and also when it started to drain water and sediments on a large scale to the Atlantic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of venom to subdue prey or deter predators has evolved multiple times in numerous animal lineages. Catfishes represent one of the most easily recognized, but least studied groups of venomous fishes. Venom glands surround spines on the dorsal and pectoral fins that serve as venom delivery structures. Species of madtom catfishes in the genus Noturus were found to each have one of four venom delivery morphologies: (1) smooth spine with no venom gland; (2) smooth spine with venom gland associated with shaft of spine; (3) serrated spine with venom gland associated with shaft of spine; and (4) serrated spine with venom gland associated with shaft of spine and posterior serrations. Analyses accounting for the phylogenetic history of Noturus species suggest that a serrated pectoral spine with a venom gland is the ancestral condition for the genus. The presence of serrations and a venom gland have been largely conserved among Noturus species, but sting morphology has changed at least five times within the genus. Four of these changes have resulted in a loss of morphological complexity, including the loss of posterior serrations, loss of venom glands associated with the posterior serrations, and one complete loss of the venom gland. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Contrary to the long-held view that the uplift of the Andes spurred biotic diversification by causing vicariance across multiple lineages with formerly continuous distributions, recent work suggests that dispersal across the Andes occurring after major uplift episodes was a major driver of speciation in Neotropical birds, with the ability of lineages to persist and disperse in the landscape being strong predictors of speciation. However, where and when dispersal events across the Andes occurred is unknown, and the role of climatic fluctuations and associated shifts in vegetation in promoting cross-Andes dispersal at different moments remains to be studied. We used models of species potential distributions based on contemporary and historical climatic data to examine scenarios of cross-Andes dispersal by 41 species of Neotropical lowland birds with varying habitat affinities. Our results indicate that ecological connectivity favoring cross-Andes dispersal at the present is higher in low-lying passes across the Andes of southern Ecuador and northern Peru than in passes in Colombia, and this spatial pattern appears to have been consistent at four different moments over the past 130,000 years. We also found that although some areas may be presently unsuitable for the dispersal of birds across the Andes, under past climatic conditions (i.e. during cooler and drier periods) they were substantially more likely to allow for ecological connectivity of populations across the cordillera. No consistent differences were found in ecological connectivity across the Andes in the present nor in the past for species occupying different habitat types. We suggest that valleys in the Andes are major drivers of evolutionary diversification not only by isolating populations of montane species, but also by allowing episodic dispersal of lowland species. Our models allow us to make predictions about gene flow which may be assessed in future studies examining fine-grain patterns of genetic exchange with landscape genetics tools. {\textcopyright} Acad.

abstract = {Understanding the spatial and temporal evolution of biota in the tropical Andes is a major challenge, given the region's topographic complexity and high beta diversity. We used a network approach to find biogeographic regions (bioregions) based on high-resolution species distribution models for 151 endemic bird taxa. Then, we used dated molecular phylogenies of 14 genera to reconstruct the area history through a sequence of allopatric speciation processes. We identified 15 biogeographical regions and found 26 events of isolation and diversification within their boundaries that are independently confirmed with disjunct distributions of sister taxa. Furthermore, these events are spatially congruent with six geographical barriers related to warm and/or dry river valleys, discontinuities in elevation, and high peaks separating fauna from different range slopes. The most important barrier is the Mara{\~{n}}on River Valley, which limits the boundaries of four bioregions and is congruent with eight phylogenetic distribution breaks, separating the Central and Northern Andes, where the most bioregions are found. We also show that many bioregions have diffuse and overlapping structures, with contact and transition zones that challenge previous conceptions of biogeographical regions as spatially simple in structure. This study found evidence that the drivers of our identified bioregions were processes of Andean uplift and mountain dispersal facilitated by temperature oscillations of the Pleistocene. Therefore, Andean bioregions were not formed from one simple biogeographical event in a certain time frame, but from a combination of vicariance and dispersal events, which occurred in different time periods.},

abstract = {The evolution of South American Cenozoic mammal communities is generally seen as encompassing three distinct faunal strata. The recently formalized Tinguirirican South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA) represents the earliest interval within Simpsons second faunal stratum and presents an exceptional opportunity to investigate a remarkable period of faunal modernization in South America. Of the 25 species currently recognized from the Tinguiririca Fauna, 17 are notoungulates, illustrating the groups diversity and abundance during this interval. Two-thirds of notoungulate species are hypsodont, in marked contrast with earlier faunas, indicating the nearly simultaneous convergent appearance of this feature in several notoungulate clades. The most diverse and abundant notoungulates at Tinguiririca are archaeohyracids (six species, the highest diversity for any locality known to date), notohippids (four species), and interatheriids (two species). Large, brachydont notoungulates are scarce. In addition to the fauna from the type locality in central Chile, several Patagonian faunas of Tinguirirican age provide important complementary taxonomic and biogeographic data. Hegetotheriids are absent from the Tinguiririca Fauna but are reported from Tinguirirican faunules in Patagonia. Trachytheriine mesotheriids are uncommon during the Tinguirirican; they have previously been reported only from Rocas Bayas in Rio Negro, though a recently prepared Chilean specimen indicates presence of the group just north of Tinguiririca during this SALMA. Faunal hypsodonty, cenograms, and rainfall estimates have previously been used to suggest that the Tinguiririca Fauna is the earliest open-habitat community in South America. This conclusion is corroborated herein through an ecological diversity analysis (EDA) that consolidates browsers and grazers into a single dietary category, to counter potential errors in hypsodonty-based dietary interpretations of extinct taxa. The statistically significant results of a multivariate discriminant model based on this EDA confirm the resemblance of the Tinguiririca Fauna to modern open habitat communities, further supporting the presence of open habitats in high latitude South America by earliest Oligocene time, despite the apparent lack of a substantial regional climatic shift across the Eocene-Oligocene Transition in Argentine Patagonia.},

abstract = {The great barracuda ( Sphyraena barracuda ) is a widespread, ecologically and socioeconomically important coastal fish, yet very little is known about its larvae. We examined spawning and larval ecology of Western Atlantic sphyraenids using monthly ichthyoplankton samples collected over 2 years along a transect spanning the east–west axis of the Straits of Florida (SOF). Samples were dominated by the great barracuda (92.8{\%}) and sennets ( Sphyraena borealis and Sphyraena picudilla ; 6.6{\%}). While larval sennets and S. barracuda displayed similar vertical distributions (majority in upper 25 m), horizontal and temporal patterns of abundance suggested a spatial and temporal species replacement between larval S. barracuda and sennets that tracks adult ecology. The diet of both taxa consisted largely of copepods, with inclusion of fish larvae at 8 mm SL, and in S. barracuda alone, a switch in the wet season to exclusive piscivory by 12 mm SL (18 days post-hatch). A lack of piscivory in S. barracuda larvae captured in the dry season corresponded to slower larval growth than in the wet season. Larval growth was also related to size-at-hatch and larval age such that larvae that were larger at hatch or larger (older) at capture grew faster at earlier ages, suggesting faster larval growth, and indirectly larger hatch size, conveys a survival advantage.

@article{DosSantos2008,
abstract = {A new approach for biogeography to find patterns of sympatry, based on network analysis, is proposed. Biogeographic analysis focuses basically on sympatry patterns of species. Sympatry is a network (= relational) datum, but it has never been analyzed before using relational tools such as Network Analysis. Our approach to biogeographic analysis consists of two parts: first the sympatry inference and second the network analysis method (NAM). The sympatry inference method was designed to propose sympatry hypothesis, constructing a basal sympatry network based on punctual data, independent of a priori distributional area determination. In this way, two or more species are considered sympatric when there is interpenetration and relative proximity among their records of occurrence. In nature, groups of species presenting within-group sympatry and between-group allopatry constitute natural units (units of co-occurrence). These allopatric units are usually connected by intermediary species. The network analysis method (NAM) that we propose here is based on the identification and removal of intermediary species to segregate units of co-occurrence, using the betweenness measure and the clustering coefficient. The species ranges of the units of co-occurrence obtained are transferred to a map, being considered as candidates to areas of endemism. The new approach was implemented on three different real complex data sets (one of them a classic example previously used in biogeography) resulting in (1) independence of predefined spatial units; (2) definition of co-occurrence patterns from the sympatry network structure, not from species range similarities; (3) higher stability in results despite scale changes; (4) identification of candidates to areas of endemism supported by strictly endemic species; (5) identification of intermediary species with particular biological attributes.},

abstract = {Measuring the pace at which speciation and extinction occur is fundamental to understanding the origin and evolution of biodiversity. Both the fossil record and molecular phylogenies of living species can provide independent estimates of speciation and extinction rates, but often produce strikingly divergent results. Despite its implications, the theoretical reasons for this discrepancy remain unknown. Here, we reveal a conceptual and methodological basis able to reconcile palaeontological and molecular evidence: discrepancies are driven by different implicit assumptions about the processes of speciation and species evolution in palaeontological and neontological analyses. We present the “birth-death chronospecies” model that clarifies the definition of speciation and extinction processes allowing for a coherent joint analysis of fossil and phylogenetic data. Using simulations and empirical analyses we demonstrate not only that this model explains much of the apparent incongruence between fossils and phylogenies, but that differences in rate estimates are actually informative about the prevalence of different speciation modes.},

abstract = {The morphological features of tooth enamel and enameloid in actinopterygian fish are reviewed to provide basic data concerning the biomineralization of teeth in lower vertebrates. Enameloid, which covers the tooth surface, is a unique well-mineralized tissue and usually has the same functions as mammalian tooth enamel. However, the development of enameloid is different from that of the enamel produced by dental epithelial cells. Enameloid is made by a combination of odontoblasts and dental epithelial cells. An organic matrix that contains collagen is provided by odontoblasts, and then dental epithelial cells dissolve the degenerate matrix and supply inorganic ions during advanced crystal growth in enameloid. It is likely that enameloid is a good model for studying the growth of well-mineralized hard tissues in vertebrates. Some actinopterygian fish possess a collar enamel layer that is situated at the surface of the tooth shaft, indicating that the origin of tooth enamel is found in fish. Collar enamel is thought to be a precursor of mammalian enamel, although it is thin and not well mineralized in comparison with enameloid. In Lepisosteus and Polypterus, both of which are living actinopterygians, both enameloid and enamel are found in the same tooth. Therefore, they are suitable materials for examining the developmental processes of enameloid and enamel and the relationship among them.},

abstract = {Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology has been used extensively to develop provenance histories for surface outcrops of key stratigraphic localities within sedimentary basins. However, many basins lack sufficiently continuous and widespread exposures of complete successions to evaluate proposed longterm tectonic histories, stratigraphic correlations, and paleodrainage patterns within individual basins. Here, we demonstrate the utility of subsurface detrital zircon U-Pb analysis by integrating ages from three key wells (21 subsurface samples) with previously reported data from six exposed intervals (90 surface samples) within a single basin. Samples from the 5-10-km-thick clastic successions span several structural blocks over an {\~{}}300 × 50 km swath of the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, a north-trending intermontane basin in the northern Andes of Colombia. Available U-Pb age distributions for modern rivers highlight the distinctive signatures of several competing sediment sources, including two major contiguous ranges (Central Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera) and two localized block uplifts (Santander Massif and San Lucas range). U-Pb results from Jurassic through Neogene stratigraphic units spanning the nine surface and subsurface sites, including several type localities, enable comparisons of provenance shifts at specific sites and spatial variations among key stratigraphic intervals across multiple sites. Distinctive age populations for the Andean magmatic arc, retroarc foldthrust belt, and South American craton facilitate correlation of stratigraphic units and reconstruction of the long-term provenance and tectonic evolution of the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin. Nearly all surface and subsurface localities show up-section changes in age spectra consistent with (1) Jurassic growth of extensional subbasins fed by local igneous sources, (2) Cretaceous deposition in an extensive postrift setting, and (3) protracted Cenozoic growth of basin-bounding ranges during Andean crustal shortening. Subsurface samples augment surface samples, highlighting their utility in developing regional source-to-sink relationships, the timing of paleodrainage integration, and tectonic reconstructions. Provenance shifts of mid-Paleocene and latest Eocene-earliest Oligocene age are consistent with incipient uplift of the flanking Central Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera, respectively. However, a well-documented phase of latest Paleocene-middle Eocene beveling of basement uplifts in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin appears to be largely aliased in the detrital record. Moreover, despite the proximity of the magmatic arc, there is insufficient syndepositional evidence for a proposed Paleogene pulse of magmatism and, in this case, limited utility of U-Pb ages in pinpointing precise depositional (stratigraphic) ages. U-Pb age spectra for Oligocene through Pliocene basin fill underscore complex along-strike (north-south) and cross-strike (east-west) variations reflective of compartmentalized transverse deposystems demarcated by pointsource contributions from the Central Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera. The late Miocene appearance of 100-0 Ma grains and a regional switch to broad, multimodal age distributions suggest the initial integration of the longitudinal proto-Magdalena River, linking the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin with southern headwaters in the Upper Magdalena Valley and likely driving increased sedimentation rates farther north in the offshore Magdalena submarine fan of the southern Caribbean margin.},

They closely resemble teeth of the fossil alepisauriforms Enchodus and Cimolichthys in overall morphology. The combination of fang-like morphology, sculpture consisting of apico-basal striations, postapical barb, absence of distal cutting edge, and wide pulp cavity surrounded by a rather thin layer of dentine is interpreted as the most basal tooth pattern in alepisauriforms. These remains may be isolated, but this study emphasizes the true value of such remains for palaeobiological studies, predicting the fossils provide characters for phylogenetic analyses.},

The transition from the primitive outgroup species "Parahippus" leonensis to the most primitive high-crowned horse, "Merychippus" gunteri occurred after about 17.7 Ma. After this event, the lowest known stratigraphic level at which diversification (i.e., presence of two or more sympatric species) of grazing merychippine horses occurs is about 16.2 Ma, or within the early part of Chron C5BR. Although this currently is the only sequence where the parahippine-merychippine transition is directly calibrated, biochronologic evidence from other important, contemporaneous localities in Texas, Nebraska, and California indicate that diversification occurred rapidly throughout North America between about 15 and 16 Ma.},

abstract = {The tropical Andes of South America, the world's richest biodiversity hotspot, are home to many rapid radiations. While geological, climatic, and ecological processes collectively explain such radiations, their relative contributions are seldom examined within a single clade. We explore the contribution of these factors by applying a series of diversification models that incorporate mountain building, climate change, and trait evolution to the first dated phylogeny of Andean bellflowers (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae). Our framework is novel for its direct incorporation of geological data on Andean uplift into a macroevolutionary model. We show that speciation and extinction are differentially influenced by abiotic factors: speciation rates rose concurrently with Andean elevation, while extinction rates decreased during global cooling. Pollination syndrome and fruit type, both biotic traits known to facilitate mutualisms, played an additional role in driving diversification. These abiotic and biotic factors resulted in one of the fastest radiations reported to date: the centropogonids, whose 550 species arose in the last 5 million yr. Our study represents a significant advance in our understanding of plant evolution in Andean cloud forests. It further highlights the power of combining phylogenetic and Earth science models to explore the interplay of geology, climate, and ecology in generating the world's biodiversity.},

BAMM estimates the diversification-rate parameters (speciation and extinction) for every branch of a study phylogeny and infers the number and location of diversification-rate shifts across branches of a tree. Our evaluation of BAMM reveals two major theoretical errors: (i) the likelihood function (which estimates the model parameters from the data) is incorrect, and (ii) the compound Poisson process prior model (which describes the prior distribution of diversification-rate shifts across branches) is incoherent. Using simulation, we demonstrate that these theoretical issues cause statistical pathologies; posterior estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are strongly influenced by the assumed prior, and estimates of diversification-rate parameters are unreliable. Moreover, the inability to correctly compute the likelihood or to correctly specify the prior for rate-variable trees precludes the use of Bayesian approaches for testing hypotheses regarding the number and location of diversification-rate shifts using BAMM.},

abstract = {South America was isolated during most of the Cenozoic, and it was home to an endemic fauna. The South American Native Ungulates (SANUs) exhibited high taxonomical, morphological, and ecological diversity and were widely distributed on the continent. However, most SANU fossil records come from high latitudes. This sampling bias challenges the study of their diversity dynamics and biogeography during important tectonic and biotic events, such as the Great American Biotic Interchange, the faunal exchange between North and South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. We describe new SANU remains from the Neogene of the Cocinetas (northern Colombia) and Falc{\'{o}}n (northwestern Venezuela) Basins. In the Cocinetas Basin, the middle Miocene fauna of the Castilletes Formation includes Hilarcotherium miyou sp. nov. (Astrapotheriidae), cf. Huilatherium (Leontiniidae), and Lambdaconus cf. L. colombianus (Proterotheriidae). The late Pliocene fauna of the Ware Formation includes a Toxodontinae indet. and the putative oldest record of Camelidae in South America. In the Falc{\'{o}}n Basin, the Pliocene/Pleistocene faunas of the Codore and San Gregorio Formations include Falcontoxodon aguilerai gen. et sp. nov. and Proterotheriidae indet. We provide a phylogenetic analysis for Astrapotheriidae and Toxodontidae. The new data document a low-latitude provinciality within some SANU clades (e.g., Astrapotheriidae, Leontiniidae) during the middle Miocene. This contrasts with the wide latitudinal distribution of clades of other mammals recorded in the fauna, including the sparassodont Lycopsis padillai, the sloth Hyperleptus?, and the proterotheriid Lambdaconus cf. L. colombianus. The Pliocene/Pleistocene tropical faunas from northern South America are characterized by the predominance of native taxa despite their proximity to the Isthmus of Panama (fully emerged by that time). Only one North American ungulate herbivore immigrant is present, a cf. Camelidae indet. The Pliocene and early Pleistocene faunas suggest that environmental changes and biotic interactions affected the diversity dynamics and biogeographic patterns of SANUs during the Great American Biotic Interchange.},

The new species differs from all congeners by the supraoccipital process not reaching the anterior nuchal plate, 43–45 total vertebrae, maxillary barbels reaching between adpressed anal-fin terminus and caudal-fin origin, epiphyseal branch of supraorbital laterosensory canal emerging as two distantly-positioned pores and a conspicuous black mark at distal third of dorsal fin, between dorsal-fin spine and third branched ray. A detailed description of the cephalic laterosensory system of the new species is provided and contrasted with other Siluriformes and Ostariophysi. A discussion regarding homology of the catfish upper pectoral girdle bones is offered in light of modifications of the postotic and supratemporal lateral-line canals. Based on the placement of the pterotic branch of the postotic canal, it is concluded that the extrascapula is fused to the pterotic in Siluriformes. Results presented herein offer an example of how lateral-line morphology can be used as a compelling source of evidence to help determine homology of cranial and upper pectoral girdle bones.},

Here, a new species of catfish, Nigerium tamaguelense sp. nov., is described from the phosphate deposits at Tamagu{\'{e}}lelt, Tilemsi Valley, based on a large collection of 29 well-preserved crania. The crania are compared with the known species of Nigerium, N. wurnoense White and N. gadense White. The genus Nigerium is reviewed and now placed in the family Claroteidae based on a combination of three derived characters. Nigerium is compared with other African fossil catfish genera and the fossil record of catfish families in Africa is reviewed. The new evidence presented here shows the Claroteidae to be the earliest occurring catfish family in Africa.

abstract = {Ostariophysi is a superorder of bony fishes including more than 10,300 species in 1100 genera and 70 families. This superorder is traditionally divided into five major groups (orders): Gonorynchiformes (milkfishes and sandfishes), Cypriniformes (carps and minnows), Characiformes (tetras and their allies), Siluriformes (catfishes), and Gymnotiformes (electric knifefishes). Unambiguous resolution of the relationships among these lineages remains elusive, with previous molecular and morphological analyses failing to produce a consensus phylogeny. In this study, we use over 350 ultraconserved element (UCEs) loci comprising 5million base pairs collected across 35 representative ostariophysan species to compile one of the most data-rich phylogenies of fishes to date. We use these data to infer higher level (interordinal) relationships among ostariophysan fishes, focusing on themonophyly of the Characiformes-one of themost contentiously debated groups in fish systematics. As withmost previous molecular studies,we recover a non-monophyletic Characiformes with the two monophyletic suborders, Citharinoidei and Characoidei, more closely related to other ostariophysan clades than to each other. We also explore incongruence between results from different UCE data sets, issues of orthology, and the use of morphological characters in combination with our molecular data.},

Characteristically for barracudas, the teeth are labiolingually flattened and fang-like with a broadly triangular and blade-like acuminate outline and sharply edged but unserrated cutting margins. These barracudas inhabited an environment that included coral reefs (based on fossil scleractinians) and seagrass beds (evidenced by the epiphytic benthic foraminifera Elphidium sp.). The relatively common occurrence of Miocene barracuda at Nosy Makamby corroborates the presence of a tropical marine ecosystem encircling Madagascar by the Miocene, likely similar overall to the environment found there today},

abstract = {Estimating divergence times on phylogenies is critical in paleontological and neontological studies. Chronostratigraphically-constrained fossils are the only direct evidence of absolute timing of species divergence. Strict temporal calibration of fossil-only phylogenies provides minimum divergence estimates, and various methods have been proposed to estimate divergences beyond these minimum values. We explore the utility of simultaneous estimation of tree topology and divergence times using BEAST tip-dating on datasets consisting only of fossils by using relaxed morphological clocks and birth-death tree priors that include serial sampling (BDSS) at a constant rate through time. We compare BEAST results to those from the traditional maximum parsimony (MP) and undated Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Three overlapping datasets were used that span 250 million years of archosauromorph evolution leading to crocodylians. The first dataset focuses on early Sauria (31 taxa, 240 chars.), the second on early Archosauria (76 taxa, 400 chars.) and the third on Crocodyliformes (101 taxa, 340 chars.). For each dataset three time-calibrated trees (timetrees) were calculated: a minimum-age timetree with node ages based on earliest occurrences in the fossil record; a ‘smoothed' timetree using a range of time added to the root that is then averaged over zero-length internodes; and a tip-dated timetree. Comparisons within datasets show that the smoothed and tip-dated timetrees provide similar estimates. Only near the root node do BEAST estimates fall outside the smoothed timetree range. The BEAST model is not able to overcome limited sampling to correctly estimate divergences considerably older than sampled fossil occurrence dates. Conversely, the smoothed timetrees consistently provide node-ages far older than the strict dates or BEAST estimates for morphologically conservative sister-taxa when they sit on long ghost lineages. In this latter case, the relaxed-clock model appears to be correctly moderating the node-age estimate based on the limited morphological divergence. Topologies are generally similar across analyses, but BEAST trees for crocodyliforms differ when clades are deeply nested but contain very old taxa. It appears that the constant-rate sampling assumption of the BDSS tree prior influences topology inference by disfavoring long, unsampled branches.},

abstract = {The Maracaibo basin in northwestern Venezuela is home to over 108 species of freshwater fishes, over half of which occur nowhere else. The rise of the M??rida Andes between 8 and 10 million years ago is believed to have divided a preexisting biota and facilitated allopatric speciation. The distinctive "phractocephaline" clade of pimelodid catfishes has a distribution that includes the Maracaibo historically and today is represented by Perrunichthys (Maracaibo endemic), Leiarius, Phractocephalus, and Steindachneridion. A resolved and well-supported phylogeny was obtained from the phylogenetic analysis of over 3.4 kb (including cytochrome b, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, recombination activating gene subunit 2). Rates of divergence among "phractocephalines" were calibrated with fossil material and the M??rida uplift. These independent calibrators provided different node-age estimates when the rates were applied separately to the gene partitions (mtDNA and rag2). Node-age discrepancies were particularly evident at older nodes. This is due to two factors: (1) multiple substitution of mtDNA underestimates the amount of change and therefore time since cladogenesis, whereas (2) calibration of an ancient node with fossils produces an artificially slow rate (due to the masking of divergence through multiple substitution) that overestimates time when applied to younger nodes. Node-age estimates provided by the more slowly evolving rag2 sequences were more consistent with other sources of historical inference, e.g., paleogeography and the fossil record. Given these points, we provide a synthetic chronology of diversification and discuss the reasons for its preference. The phylogeny and synthetic chronology suggest Perrunichthys perruno (Maracaibo endemic) and Leiarius pictus (Orinoco and Guianas) to be a vicariant species pair that last shared a common ancestor during the period of M??rida uplift. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Hoplias aimara is a predatory South American teleostean fish. It has caniniform teeth that show parallel, surface ridges at their base. The dentine of the teeth is divided in two layers: an inner layer of circumpulpal dentine and an external one of pallial dentine, and their apical top has a lightly flattened cap of enameloid. A peculiar specificity of the teeth is the presence of plicidentine in their basal part, which is thought to strengthen the tooth attachment. This is a new example of plicidentine in teleostean teeth following its description in the lingual teeth of the osteoglossid Arapaima gigas. Some other ichthyophagous Characiformes also show caniniformes teeth with plicidentine: Hydrocynus, Hydrolycus. So, in the Actinopterygii, plicidentine is not limited to the lepisosteids only. We interpret plicidentine in the teeth of these actinopterygian fishes as a morphofunctional adaptation to a predatory life style.},

abstract = {South America have been recovered from levels of the Hansen Member of the Salamanca Formation, Punta Peligro locality in Argentina, and from the Santa Lucı´a Formation in Tiupampa, Bolivia. These faunas led to the recognition of the Peligran and Tiupampan South American Land Mammal Ages (SALMAs), each alternatively regarded as the oldest Paleocene SALMA. Due to the lack of radioisotopic dates for mammals bearing levels at these localities, no agreement has been reached yet about their relative ages. In this paper, the role of mammal faunas in age inference is discussed. Analysis of the SALMAs shows that the presence of non-therian mammals in the Peligran is of little consequence to the biochronological evaluation, reflecting instead a relict Mesozoic distribution. In contrast, therian mammals are particularly important in that (1) they were Lauraisan immigrants and (2) they support direct comparisons between the Tiupampa and Punta Peligro faunas. Parsimony and cluster analysis were used to quantitatively test hypotheses concerning the relative age of the Peligran and Tiupampan SALMAs. Our results support the hypothesis that the Tiupampan SALMA (early Danian) is older than the Peligran SALMA (early Selandian). This alignment results in an interpretation of the evolutionary history of South American land mammals that is more straightforward than the alternative.},

abstract = {Aim To evaluate the role of historical processes in the evolution of Sclerurus leaftossers by integrating phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. Location Humid forests of the Neotropical region. Methods We reconstructed the evolutionary history of Sclerurus based on DNA sequences representing all species and 20 of the 26 recognized subspecies using one autosomal nuclear locus and three protein-coding mitochondrial gene sequences. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. We used Bayesian coalescent-based approaches to evaluate demographic changes through time, and to estimate the timing of diversification events. Based on these results, we examined the temporal accumulation of divergence events using lineage-through-time plots. Results The monophyly of all Sclerurus species was strongly supported except for Sclerurus mexicanus, which was paraphyletic in relation to Sclerurus rufigularis, and for the sister pair Sclerurus scansor–Sclerurus albigularis, which were not reciprocally monophyletic in the nuclear tree. We found remarkably deep phylogeographical structure within all Sclerurus species, and overall this structure was congruent with currently recognized subspecies and Neotropical areas of endemism. Diversification within Sclerurus has occurred at a relatively constant rate since the Middle Miocene. Main conclusions Our results strongly support the relevance of physiographical (e.g. Nicaragua Depression, Isthmus of Panama, Andean Cordillera, great rivers of Amazonia) and ecological barriers (open vegetation corridor) and ecological gradients (elevational zonation) to the diversification of Neotropical forest-dwelling organisms. Despite the high congruence among the spatial patterns identified, the variance in divergence times suggests multiple speciation events occurring independently across the same barrier, and a role for dispersal. The phylogenetic patterns and cryptic diversity uncovered in this study demonstrate that the current taxonomy of Sclerurus underestimates the number of species.},

abstract = {Macroevolution, encompassing the deep-time patterns of the origins of modern biodiversity, has been discussed in many contexts. Non-Darwinian models such as macromutations have been proposed as a means of bridging seemingly large gaps in knowledge, or as a means to explain the origin of exquisitely adapted body plans. However, such gaps can be spanned by new fossil finds, and complex, integrated organisms can be shown to have evolved piecemeal. For example, the fossil record between dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx has now filled up with astonishing fossil intermediates that show how the unique plexus of avian adaptations emerged step by step over 60 Myr. New numerical approaches to morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods allow palaeontologists and biologists to work together on deep-time questions of evolution, to explore how diversity, morphology and function have changed through time. Patterns are more complex than sometimes expected, with frequent decoupling of species diversity and morphological diversity, pointing to the need for some new generalizations about the processes that lie behind such patterns.},

abstract = {Suprafamilial relationships among characiform fishes and implications for the taxonomy and biogeographic history of the Characiformes were investigated by parsimony analysis of four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes across 124 ingroup and 11 outgroup taxa. Simultaneous analysis of 3660 aligned base pairs from the mitochondrial 16S and cytochrome b genes and the nuclear recombination activating gene (RAG2), seven in absentia (sia), forkhead (fkh), and ??-tropomyosin (trop) gene loci confirmed the non-monophyly of the African and Neotropical assemblages and corroborated many suprafamilial groups proposed previously on the basis of morphological features. The African distichodontids plus citharinids were strongly supported as a monophyletic Citharinoidei that is the sistergroup to all other characiforms, which form a monophyletic Characoidei composed of two large clades. The first represents an assemblage of both African and Neotropical taxa, wherein a monophyletic African Alestidae is sister to a smaller clade comprised of the Neotropical families Ctenolucidae, Lebiasinidae, and the African Hepsetidae, with that assemblage sister to a strictly Neotropical clade comprised of the Crenuchidae and Erythrinidae. The second clade within the Characoidei is strictly Neotropical and includes all other Characiformes grouped into two well supported major clades. The first, corresponding to a traditional definition of the Characidae, is congruent with some groupings previously supported by morphological evidence. The second clade comprises a monophyletic Anostomoidea that is sister to a clade formed by the families Hemiodontidae, Parodontidae, and Serrasalmidae, with that assemblage, in turn, the sistergroup of the Cynodontidae. Serrasalmidae, traditionally regarded as a subfamily of Characidae, was recovered as the sistergroup of (Anostomoidea (Parodontidae + Hemiodontidae)) and the family Cynodontidae was recovered with strong support as the sistergroup to this assemblage. Our results reveal three instances of trans-continental sistergroup relationships and, in light of the fossil evidence, suggest that marine dispersal cannot be ruled out a priori and that a simple model of vicariance does not readily explain the biogeographic history of the characiform fishes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on these analyses we investigate the spatial and temporal origins and diversification of the group. Location Mesoamerica. Methods Model-based phylogenetic methods (MrBayes) using seven molecu- lar markers with a virtually complete species-level taxon sampling, together with the Bayesian approach to statistical dispersal–vicariance analysis (S-DIVA), and fossil- and palaeogeography-calibrated beast molecular clock analyses were used to assess the timing of dispersal, vicariance and diversification events. Results We present a robust multigene phylogeny resolved from the deepest nodes to the species level. Two colonizations of Middle America and one of the Greater Antilles occurred from South America within a narrow time window during the Oligocene epoch. Cichlid colonization of Central America proceeded from the north in the Early–Middle Miocene. Central America later became repeatedly fragmented during the latter half of the Miocene, which led to the formation of the present ichthyological provinces prior to the final closure of the Panama Isthmus. Main conclusions The heroine cichlid fishes colonized the Greater Antilles and Middle America simultaneously through the GAARlandia land bridge during the Oligocene. Central America (including eastern Panama) was colo- nized from northern Middle America in the Early–Middle Miocene. Thus our results do not support a direct colonization of Middle America from South America, or a Cretaceous–Palaeocene colonization through the proto-Antilles, or a colonization of the Greater Antilles from Middle America as suggested by previous studies.},

abstract = {The great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda, is a voracious marine predator that captures fish with a swift ram feeding strike. While aspects of its ram feeding kinematics have been examined, an unexamined aspect of their feeding strategy is the bite mechanism used to process prey. Barracuda can attack fish larger than the gape of their jaws, and in order to swallow large prey, can sever their prey into pieces with powerful jaws replete with sharp cutting teeth. Our study examines the functional morphology and biomechanics of 'ram-biting' behavior in great barracuda where the posterior portions of the oral jaws are used to slice through prey. Using fresh fish and preserved museum specimens, we examined the jaw mechanism of an ontogenetic series of barracuda ranging from 20 g to 8.2 kg. Jaw functional morphology was described from dissections of fresh specimens and bite mechanics were determined from jaw morphometrics using the software MandibLever (v3.2). High-speed video of barracuda biting (1500 framess(-1)) revealed that prey are impacted at the corner of the mouth during capture in an orthogonal position where rapid repeated bites and short lateral headshakes result in cutting the prey in two. Predicted dynamic force output of the lower jaw nearly doubles from the tip to the corner of the mouth reaching as high as 58 N in large individuals. A robust palatine bone embedded with large dagger-like teeth opposes the mandible at the rear of the jaws providing for a scissor-like bite capable of shearing through the flesh and bone of its prey.},

The oldest pleurodire record in Florida is from the end of the Greenhouse World in the middle to late Eocene, followed by a hiatus of {\~{}} 11 million yrs during the onset of the Icehouse World in the early Oligocene. Their sojourn in Florida during the latest Oligocene (25-24 Ma) was concurrent with a brief late Oligocene warming (LOW), and a subsequent hiatus in the early Miocene ({\~{}} 24-18 Ma) was contemporaneous with global cooling. Their resettlement and most populous occurrences in Florida during the middle to late Hemingfordian through early Barstovian ({\~{}} 18-15.5 Ma) coincided with the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), a significant global warming event. Pleurodires are indicators that paleoclimate in the southeastern United States was frost free during the Eocene, LOW, and MMCO with air and water temperatures warm enough to support these generally cold-intolerant turtles. A small-bodied podocnemidid existed in the Cucaracha Formation {\~{}} 19.05-18.8 Ma) of Panama during the early Miocene pleurodire hiatus in Florida, and this or a closely related taxon later dispersed into Florida by the early Barstovian, when temperatures were suitable during the MMCO. Previously reported pleurodire fossils from the temporally mixed Lee Creek Mine of North Carolina are most likely middle Miocene in age when pleurodires were common in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. The presence of pleurodires in the Seaboard Local Fauna could help constrain the age of the fauna to younger than 18 Ma and probably closer to 17 Ma based on hypothesized paleoclimate at that time. A pleurodire from the middle Eocene Point "A" Dam site in southern Alabama may represent a late occurrence of the Bothremydidae.},

abstract = {We used the results of phylogenetic analyses of relationships among spider monkeys (Ateles) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to investigate questions of their evolutionary origins and speciation mechanisms. We employed the concept of a local molecular clock to date nodes of interest (corresponding to hypothesized species and subspecies) in the various phylograms for comparison to hypothesized biogeographical events that might have affected speciation. We considered various mechanisms-Pleistocene refuge formation, riverine barriers, geological fluctuations, and ecological changes associated with these mechanisms-for their contribution to speciation in Ateles. Most speciation among the various species of Ateles occurred during the middle to late Pliocene, suggesting that Pleistocene refuge formation was not a key speciation mechanism. However, it is likely that the genetic structure of populations of Ateles was modified to some extent by refuge formation. Additionally, riverine barriers do not seem to interrupt gene flow significantly among Ateles. No river formed a barrier among species of Ateles, with the exception of the lower Amazon and possibly some of the black- water rivers draining the Guianan highlands. Large-scale geographic changes associated with the continued rise of the eastern and western cordilleras of the northern Alines and associated changes in habitat were the most important causes of speciation in Ateles. The various factors that modify genetic structure in ateles are important to consider in order to protect endangered primate genera in the Neotropics.},

abstract = {By means of the analysis of 28 modern individuals of Pterodoras granulosus, a silurid of great importance in the archaeological assemblages of the Amazonas and Paran{\'{a}} basins, allometric equations based on the size of the spines have been derived, allowing the reconstruction of size profile and weight of the individuals recovered in fossil assemblages. These equations have been obtained from four different measures, three of them related to different sections of the spine articulation with the cleithrum, an area that usually has an excellent preservation in the archaeological and palaeontological records. This study allows observation of remarkable individual variability of the captured specimens regarding its total weight, mainly due to the weight variability of viscera, and also probably with other metabolic situations, episodic intakes and/or reproductive aspects, among others. Hence, allometric equations determine more accurately length than weight, resulting in proxy data for the reconstruction of different size profiles of archaeological assemblages. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {It is well known that predators can induce morphological changes in some fish: individuals exposed to predation cues increase body depth and the length of spines. We hypothesize that these structures may evolve synergistically, as together, these traits will further enlarge the body dimensions of the fish that gape-limited predators must overcome. We therefore expect that the orientation of the spines will predict which body dimension increases in the presence of predators. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested this prediction on the macroevolutionary scale across 347 teleost families, which display considerable variation in fin spines, body depth and width. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that fin spines on the vertical plane (dorsal and anal fins) are associated with a deeper-bodied optimum. Lineages with spines on the horizontal plane (pectoral fins) are associated with a wider-bodied optimum. Optimal body dimensions across lineages without spines paralleling the body dimension match the allometric expectation. Additionally, lineages with longer spines have deeper and wider body dimensions. This evolutionary relationship between fin spines and body dimensions across teleosts reveals functional synergy between these two traits and a potential macroevolutionary signature of predation on the evolutionary dynamics of body shape.},

abstract = {A central challenge facing the temporal calibration of molecular phylogenies is finding a quantitative method for estimating maximum age constraints on lineage divergence times. Here, I provide such a method. This method requires an ultrametric tree generated without reference to the fossil record. Exploiting the fact that the relative branch lengths on the ultrametric tree are proportional to time, this method identifies the lineage with the greatest proportion of its true temporal range covered by the fossil record. The oldest fossil of this calibration lineage is used as the minimum age constraint. The maximum age constraint is obtained by adding a confidence interval onto the end point of the calibration lineage, thus making it possible to bracket the true divergence times of all lineages on the tree. The approach can also identify fossils that have been grossly misdated or misassigned to the phylogeny. The method assumes that the relative branch lengths on the ultrametric tree are accurate and that fossilization is random. The effect of violations of these assumptions is assessed. This method is simple to use and is illustrated with a reanalysis of Near et al.'s turtle data.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Cocinetas Basin is located on the eastern flank of La Guajira Peninsula, northern Colombia (South Caribbean). During late Oligocene through Pliocene, much of the basin was submerged. The extensive deposits in this area suggest a transition from a shallow marine to a fluvio–deltaic system, with a rich record of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. The elasmobranch assemblages of the early Miocene to late Pliocene succession in the Cocinetas Basin (Jimol, Castilletes and Ware Formations, and Pats{\'{u}}a Valley) are described for the first time. The assemblages include at least 30 taxa of sharks (Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes and Carcharhiniformes) and batoids (Rhinopristiformes and Myliobatiformes), of which 24 taxa are reported from the Colombian Neogene for the first time. Paleoecological and paleoenvironmental interpretations are based on the feeding ecology, and on estimates of paleosalinity using stable isotope compositions of oxygen in the bioapatite of shark teeth. The isotopic composition of studied specimens corroborates the paleoenvironmental settings for the studied units suggested on the basis of other proxies. These Neogene elasmobranch assemblages from the Cocinetas Basin, provide new insights of the shark and ray diversity inhabiting the coastal and estuarine environments of the northwestern margin of South America, both during the existence of the gateway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and following its closure},

The specimens are referred to the species Protosphyraena ferox, based on the morphology of the pectoral fin. This attribution is consistent with the paleobiogeographic distribution and stratigraphic range of this taxon. The Italian material provides new information about the distribution in time and space of Protosphyraena, which is relatively poorly known despite being an iconic taxon. The Italian remains, although fragmentary, contribute to fill a gap in the central Tethys record of the genus, whose range probably extended worldwide, considering also the genus Australopachycormus and its profound (possibly congeneric) similarities.},

abstract = {Although rare within the context of 30 000 species of extant fishes, scale-feeding as an ecological strategy has evolved repeatedly across the teleost tree of life. Scale-feeding (lepidophagous) fishes are diverse in terms of their ecology, behaviour, and specialized morphologies for grazing on scales and mucus of sympatric species. Despite this diversity, the underlying ontogenetic changes in functional and biomechanical properties of associated feeding morphologies in lepidophagous fishes are less understood. We examined the ontogeny of feeding mechanics in two evolutionary lineages of scale-feeding fishes: Roeboides , a characin, and Catoprion , a piranha. We compare these two scale-feeding taxa with their nearest, non-lepidophagous taxa to identify traits held in common among scale-feeding fishes. We use a combination of micro-computed tomography scanning and iodine staining to measure biomechanical predictors of feeding behaviour such as tooth shape, jaw lever mechanics and jaw musculature. We recover a stark contrast between the feeding morphology of scale-feeding and non-scale-feeding taxa, with lepidophagous fishes displaying some paedomorphic characters through to adulthood. Few traits are shared between lepidophagous characins and piranhas, except for their highly-modified, stout dentition. Given such variability in development, morphology and behaviour, ecological diversity within lepidophagous fishes has been underestimated.},

The fossils show diagnostic characters that identify them as belonging to Kogiidae, such as three spines in the anterior process, presence of an incudal process, and a posterior process oriented along the long axis of the bone. Morphological comparisons and morphometric and statistical analyses of periotic proportions confirm the presence of a large and a small morphotype within the sample. The large morphotype (mean length D 39.76 mm) belongs to an unknown kogiid that occurs in both formations, whereas the small morphotype (mean length D 28.64 mm), referred to aff. Kogia sp., occurs only in the Yorktown Formation. The cooccurrence of two taxa in North Carolina may represent one of the earliest evidences of sympatry in kogiids and may demonstrate that this ecological behavior has been part of the natural history of this group at least since the deposition of the Yorktown Formation at Lee Creek (»4.8–3.1 Ma). In addition, the occurrence of the large morphotype in the upper Bone Valley Formation, herein reported for the first time, shows that we are still far from understanding the diversity of marine mammals of that formation and that revision of newly acquired material is necessary.},

abstract = {Fossil information is essential for estimating species divergence times, and can be integrated into Bayesian phylogenetic inference using the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process. An important aspect of palaeontological data is the uncertainty surrounding specimen ages, which can be handled in different ways during inference. The most common approach is to fix fossil ages to a point estimate within the known age interval. Alternatively, age uncertainty can be incorporated by using priors, and fossil ages are then directly sampled as part of the inference. This study presents a comparison of alternative approaches for handling fossil age uncertainty in analysis using the FBD process. Based on simulations, we find that fixing fossil ages to the midpoint or a random point drawn from within the stratigraphic age range leads to biases in divergence time estimates, while sampling fossil ages leads to estimates that are similar to inferences that employ the correct ages of fossils. Second, we show a comparison using an empirical dataset of extant and fossil cetaceans, which confirms that different methods of handling fossil age uncertainty lead to large differences in estimated node ages. Stratigraphic age uncertainty should thus not be ignored in divergence time estimation and instead should be incorporated explicitly.},

abstract = {After a short introduction on generalities about probability distributions, the book consists of 40 chapters describing in alphabetical order individual distributions commonly encountered in applications. It is a substantially revised edition with, in particular, new diagrams and a longer treatment of the Weibull distribution in its two, three and five parameter forms. With two exceptions the distributions are univariate, i.e. one-dimensional. Typically for each distribution there is an introductory paragraph about potential applications, the formula for the distribution, the main properties of the distribution, usually some diagrams illustrating the shape of the distribution, and some notes on relations with other distributions and on how its parameters might be estimated from data. In some cases a note on simulation of values is included. The book ends with some computational references, some statistical tables and a short bibliography. The book contains a large amount of information clearly set out in concise form. The introductory notes on the motivation for the individual distributions are sometimes perfunctory and inevitably are no substitute for a careful discussion of the domain of potential applicability of, for example, the exponential distribution or the negative binomial distribution. They are of little or no help in dealing with the question: `Here is a particular kind of problem calling for a simple form of probability distribution: what kind of distribution might be useful?' However, the book could certainly be a valuable reference source on such specific if rather narrow questions as: `Given involvement in the use of the negative binomial distribution, what are its moments?' A criticism of the book is the failure to give references for further reading about individual special distributions. The short general bibliography is no help on where to look for particular points.

abstract = {Palynological results from opposite sides of the northernmost Antarctic Peninsula provide insight on terrestrial vegetation and sea-surface conditions immediately before the Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT), through Early Oligocene glacial conditions and the subsequent Late Oligocene interglacial interval. A latest Eocene sample set from the uppermost La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, James Ross (back-arc) Basin, records a low-diversity Nothofagus (southern beech)-dominated vegetation with some podocarp conifers similar to Valdivian-type forest found today in Chile and Argentina. Marine organic-walled phytoplankton include leiospheres and Eocene dinoflagellate cysts such as Vozzhennikovia rotunda, V. apertura, Senegalinium asymmetricum and Spinidinium macmurdoense. Immediately before the EOT near the top of the section the decrease in terrestrial palynomorphs, increase in reworked specimens, disappearance of key dinocysts, and overwhelming numbers of sea-ice-indicative leiospheres plus the small dinoflagellate cyst Impletosphaeridium signal the onset of glacial conditions in a subpolar climate. Early to Late Oligocene samples from the Polonez Cove and Boy Point formations on King George Island, South Shetland Islands (magmatic arc), yielded an extremely depauperate terrestrial flora, likely resulting in part from poor vegetation cover during the Polonez Glaciation but also because of destruction of vegetation due to continued regional volcanism. The prevalence of sea-ice-indicative leiospheres in the marine palynomorph component is consistent with polar to subpolar conditions during and following the Polonez Glaciation.},

abstract = {The infraclass Teleostei is a highly diversified group of bony fishes that encompasses 96{\%} of all species of living fishes and almost half of extant vertebrates. Evolution of various morphological complexes in teleosts, particularly those involving soft anatomy, remains poorly understood. Notable among these problematic complexes is the adductor mandibulae, the muscle that provides the primary force for jaw adduction and mouth closure and whose architecture varies from a simple arrangement of two segments to an intricate complex of up to ten discrete subdivisions. The present study analyzed multiple morphological attributes of the adductor mandibulae in representatives of 53 of the 55 extant teleostean orders, as well as significant information from the literature in order to elucidate the homologies of the main subdivisions of this muscle. The traditional alphanumeric terminology applied to the four main divisions of the adductor mandibulae - A1, A2, A3, and A$\omega$ - patently fails to reflect homologous components of that muscle across the expanse of the Teleostei. Some features traditionally used as landmarks for identification of some divisions of the adductor mandibulae proved highly variable across the Teleostei; notably the insertion on the maxilla and the position of muscle components relative to the path of the ramus mandibularis trigeminus nerve. The evolutionary model of gain and loss of sections of the adductor mandibulae most commonly adopted under the alphanumeric system additionally proved ontogenetically incongruent and less parsimonious than a model of subdivision and coalescence of facial muscle sections. Results of the analysis demonstrate the impossibility of adapting the alphanumeric terminology so as to reflect homologous entities across the spectrum of teleosts. A new nomenclatural scheme is proposed in order to achieve congruence between homology and nomenclature of the adductor mandibulae components across the entire Teleostei.},

abstract = {Marshall (1995) used the distribution of the endpoints of 50{\%} range extensions added to the stratigraphic ranges of individual taxa to bracket the position of an extinction boundary. Here we describe two improvements to Marshall's method. First, we show that more precise estimates of the position of such a boundary may be obtained using range extensions with confidence levels of less than 50{\%} (e.g., 20{\%}). Second, we introduce a new method of calculating confidence intervals that explicitly takes into account the position of the highest fossil find. Incorporating these improvements leads to confidence intervals for simulated data sets that are approximately four times more precise than those obtained by using Marshall's (1995) original method and approximately twice as precise as those using other published methods. We provide a look-up table that shows for different numbers of taxa the confidence level that should be used to maximize the precision of the estimated position of the extinction boundary, while ensuring that the boundary still lies within the stratigraphic interval bounded by at least one range extension. Unlike some other methods, our method is nonparametric and does not make the restrictive assumption of uniform preservation and recovery potential. We apply the method to Macellari's (1986) ammonite data from the late Cretaceous of Seymour Island, Antarctica.},

The lateral migration of the pirarucu accompanied water level fluctuations closely. As water levels rose, the pirarucu migrated to increasingly higher habitats in flooded forests and remained there during high water levels. As water levels declined, the pirarucu migrated first back to lower habitats of flooded forests, then to communicating channels, and, eventually, to the lakes, where they remained during low water levels. These results allow for a conceptual model of lateral migration of floodplain fishes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

abstract = {Although experimental evidence is lacking, the stout pectoral spine of catfishes has been interpreted as a defensive adaptation. The spine can be rigidly locked and abducted to produce stridulation sounds, which have been hypothesized to serve a warning function. We studied spine function in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) as a deterrent to predation by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) by presenting individuals with pairs of catfish, one with its pectoral spines clipped and the other intact. The number of initial attacks on clipped and intact fish was similar, suggesting that bass do not recognize the spine visually. Bass showed evidence of learning across trials, striking clipped fish fewer times and consuming them. Conversely, intact fish were attacked more than clipped ones because intact fish were repeatedly disgorged and attacked again, suggesting that bass become sensitized to the spine. Ingestion times were longer for intact than clipped fish, and fewer intact fish were eaten. Eighty-eight percent of intact fish survived in the mouth of a bass one or more times. Catfish did not stridulate or use their spines to deter initial attacks, refuting the warning hypothesis. Locking and stridulation motions, only observed when catfish were held inside the mouth of a bass, did not deter subsequent attacks indicating that neither the spine nor stridulation carry a warning function. It is possible, therefore, that stridulation sounds function as a distress call. The spine functions against a gape-limited predator by increasing the difficulty of ingestion but not capture.},

The La Meseta Formation is composed of poorly consolidated, marine sandstones and siltstones which were deposited in a coastal, deltaic and/or estuarine environment. It includes marine invertebrates and vertebrates as well as terrestrial vertebrates and plants. The highly fossiliferous basal horizon (Cucullaea shell bed, Telm 4 of Sadler 1988) of the Cucullaea I Allomember is a laterally extensive shell bed with sandy matrix. The fish remains, including 35 species from 26 families, of the Ypresian Cucullaea bed represent one of the most abundant and diverse fossil vertebrate faunas yet recorded in southern latitudes. Stratigraphic distribution and phylogenetic relationships of the Weddellian sphenisciforms are consistent with a first radiation of this group in the Early Eocene. The first inquestionable archaeocete from Antarctica is recorded in this unit and is referred to a new taxon.},

abstract = {Time-calibrated phylogenies based on molecular data provide a framework for comparative studies. Calibration methods to combine fossil information with molecular phylogenies are, however, under active development, often generating disagreement about the best way to incorporate paleontological data into these analyses. This study provides an empirical comparison of the most widely used approach based on node-dating priors for relaxed clocks implemented in the programs BEAST and MrBayes, with two recently proposed improvements: one using a new fossilized birth-death process model for node dating (implemented in the program DPPDiv), and the other using a total-evidence or tip-dating method (implemented in MrBayes and BEAST). These methods are applied herein to tetraodontiform fishes, a diverse group of living and extinct taxa that features one of the most extensive fossil records among teleosts. Previous estimates of time-calibrated phylogenies of tetraodontiforms using node-dating methods reported disparate estimates for their age of origin, ranging from the late Jurassic to the early Paleocene (ca. 150-59. Ma). We analyzed a comprehensive dataset with 16 loci and 210 morphological characters, including 131 taxa (95 extant and 36 fossil species) representing all families of fossil and extant tetraodontiforms, under different molecular clock calibration approaches. Results from node-dating methods produced consistently younger ages than the tip-dating approaches. The older ages inferred by tip dating imply an unlikely early-late Jurassic (ca. 185-119. Ma) origin for this order and the existence of extended ghost lineages in their fossil record. Node-based methods, by contrast, produce time estimates that are more consistent with the stratigraphic record, suggesting a late Cretaceous (ca. 86-96. Ma) origin. We show that the precision of clade age estimates using tip dating increases with the number of fossils analyzed and with the proximity of fossil taxa to the node under assessment. This study suggests that current implementations of tip dating may overestimate ages of divergence in calibrated phylogenies. It also provides a comprehensive phylogenetic framework for tetraodontiform systematics and future comparative studies.},

abstract = {The Cracidae are Neotropical galliform birds with 11 genera currently recognized. To investigate the questioned validity of Pipile Bonaparte, 1856 and the monotypic Aburria Reichenbach, 1853 as separate genera, we gathered data from 2727 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b, ND2 and control region) and 151 osteological characters. Our phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences indicated that Aburria aburri is embedded within Pipile. Also, genetic distances between Aburria and any Pipile species are equivalent to the distances estimated for other congeneric cracid species, which genus status is not doubtful. Although the osteological characters do not have phylogenetic signal to solve the phylogenetic relationships at species level, five synapomorphies were found for Aburria and Pipile. Therefore, we suggest that Pipile should be merged with Aburria, which is the oldest described genus. We estimated that speciation in this group occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, concordant with other birds, primates and rodents that have similar geographic distribution, and proposed a diversification hypothesis based on the occurrence of sea transgressions and the formation of the Amazon Lagoon. Therefore, we conclude that these palaeogeographic events may have contributed to Neotropical taxa diversification to a greater extent than previously suspected. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Fossil acanthomorph fishes from the Cretaceous and early Tertiary (Paleocene, early Eocene) of the world are reviewed. There are no Lower Cretaceous acanthomorphs. The Cenomanian, the earliest stage of the Upper Cretaceous, has yielded over 20 genera of acanthomorphs belonging to about five extant taxa: Polymixiidae, Trachichthyoidei, Holocentroidei, Tetraodontiformes, and possibly Zeiformes. The remainder of the Upper Cretaceous adds relatively little to this diversity, but contains the earliest paracanthopterygian and gasterosteiform, and one possible perciform. It is notable that all the better-known Cretaceous acanthomorphs are polymixiids, stem-group acanthomorphs, and stem-group trachichthyoids or holocentroids. The Cretaceous tetraodontiforms, gasterosteiform, and possible zeiforms and perciform are represented by single diminutive specimens, or by incompletely described material, so that in every case there is doubt about their structure and relationships. There is a marked gap of about 20 million years in the acanthomorph record between the late Campanian (ca. 75 Ma) and the late Paleocene (ca. 55 Ma). By the late Paleocene, there is a diverse fauna of paracanthopterygians, gasterosteiforms and perciforms, and lampridiforms and zeiforms are also present. Monte Bo1ca, at the base of the Middle Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), contains a diversity of acanthomorphs clearly foreshadowing the Recent fauna. Progrcss in the systematics of Rccent acanthomorphs (characterization of groups and subgroups) is necessary beforc more scnse can be made of early fossil acanthomorphs.},

abstract = {Teleost fishes comprise approximately half of all living vertebrates. The extreme range of diversity in teleosts is remarkable, especially, extensive morphological variation in their jaws and dentition. Some of the most unusual dentitions are found among members of the highly derived teleost order Tetraodontiformes, which includes triggerfishes, boxfishes, ocean sunfishes, and pufferfishes. Adult pufferfishes (Tetraodontidae) exhibit a distinctive parrot-like beaked jaw, forming a cutting edge, unlike in any other group of teleosts. Here we show that despite novelty in the structure and development of this "beak," it is initiated by formation of separate first-generation teeth that line the embryonic pufferfish jaw, with timing of development and gene expression patterns conserved from the last common ancestor of osteichthyans. Most of these first-generation larval teeth are lost in development. Continuous tooth replacement proceeds in only four parasymphyseal teeth, as sequentially stacked, multigenerational, jaw-length dentine bands, before development of the functional beak. These data suggest that dental novelties, such as the pufferfish beak, can develop later in ontogeny through modified continuous tooth addition and replacement. We conclude that even highly derived morphological structures like the pufferfish beak form via a conserved developmental bauplan capable of modification during ontogeny by subtle respecification of the developmental module.},

abstract = {A cladistic biogeographical analysis was undertaken to identify the main events in the biotic diversification of the terrestrial Neotropical biota. For the 36 animal and plant taxa analysed, a component 9 area matrix was constructed, associating geo- graphical data only with informative nodes, and it was analysed under implied weights using the software TNT. The general area cladogram obtained shows that the Neotropical region constitutes a monophyletic unit, with a first split separating the Antilles and a second one dividing the continental areas into a north-western and a south-eastern component. Within the north- western component the areas split following the sequence northern Amazonia, south-western Amazonia, north-western South America, and Mesoamerica. Within the south-eastern component the areas split following the sequence south-eastern Amazonia, Chaco, and Parana. The three main components are treated as subregions: Antillean, Amazonian (northern Amazonian, south- western Amazonian, Mesoamerican, and north-western South American dominions), and Chacoan (south-eastern Amazonian, Chacoan, and Parana dominions). Dispersal and vicariant events postulated to explain these pattens might have occurred during the Cretaceous, when the Caribbean plate collided with the Americas, a combination of eustatic sea-level changes and tectonic deformations of the continental platform exposed large parts of South America to episodes of marine transgressions, and the Andean uplift reconfigured the Amazonian area. Tertiary and Quaternary events are assumed to have later induced the diversifi- cation within these large biogeographical units.},

abstract = {The onset of deformation in the northern Andes is overprinted by subsequent stages of basin deformation, complicating the examination of competing models illustrating potential location of earliest synorogenic basins and uplifts. To establish the width of the earliest northern Andean orogen, we carried out field mapping, palynological dating, sedimentary, stratigraphic and provenance analyses in Campanian to lower Eocene units exposed in the northern Eastern Cordillera of Colombia (Cocuy region) and compare the results with coeval succession in adjacent basins. The onset of deformation is recorded in earliest Maastrichtian time, as terrigenous detritus arrived into the basin marking the end of chemical precipitation and the onset of clastic deposition produced by the uplift of a western source area dominated by shaly Cretaceous rocks. Disconformable contacts within the upper Maastrichtian to middle Paleocene succession document increasing supply of quartzose sandy detritus from Cretaceous quartzose rocks exposed in eastern source areas. The continued unroofing of both source areas produced a rapid shift in depositional environments from shallow marine in Maastrichtian to fluvial‐lacustrine systems during the Paleocene‐early Eocene. Supply of immature Jurassic sandstones from nearby western uplifts, together with localized plutonic and volcanic Cretaceous rocks, caused a shift in Paleocene sandstones composition from quartzarenites to litharenites. Supply of detrital sandy fragments, unstable heavy minerals and Cretaceous to Ordovician detrital zircons, were derived from nearby uplifted blocks and from SW fluvial systems within the synorogenic basin, instead of distal basement rocks. The presence of volcanic rock fragments and 51‐59 Ma volcanic zircons constrain magmatism within the basin. The Maastrichtian ‐ Paleocene sequence studied here documents crustal deformation that correlates with coeval deformation farther south in Ecuador and Peru. Slab flattening of the subducting Caribbean plate produced a wider orogen ({\textgreater}400 km) with a continental magmatic arc and intra‐basinal deformation and magmatism.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate activation of inhibitory regulation pathways by methamphetamine (METH)-withdrawal stress in rat salivary gland. Our previous study showed that METH-withdrawal stress activated steroid biosynthesis and that pregnenolone produced during the early stage of this process inhibited salivary secretion. However, how this type of stress inhibits salivary secretion and the activation pathway of steroid biosynthesis in salivary gland remain to be clarified. In the present study, using an in vivo cannulation method, METH-withdrawal stress decreased salivary secretion and increased expression of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist; Western blot and RT-PCR also showed increased expression of DBI mRNA in parotid, submandibular, and sublingual gland. In addition, METH-withdrawal stress also elicited an increase in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and PBR mRNA, which is associated with DBI activity. These results suggest that METH-withdrawal stress activates a PACAP-DBI pathway in salivary gland, enhancing steroid genesis and inhibiting secretion},

@article{Strauss1989,
abstract = {The observed local range of a fossil taxon in a stratigraphic section is almost certainly a truncated version of the true local range. True endpoints are parameters that may be estimated using only the assumption that fossil finds are distributed randomly between them. If thickness is rescaled so that true endpoints lie at 0 and 1, the joint distribution of gap lengths between fossil finds is given by the Dirichlet distribution. Observed ends of the range are maximum likelihood estimators of true endpoints, but they are biased seriously. Extension of the observed range at each end by a distance equal to the average gap length yields unbiased point estimators. Classical statistics can generate confidence intervals for ends of the taxon range; but with Bayesian inference, the probability that true endpoints lie in a certain region can be stated. For a 95{\%} confidence level (classical) or a 95{\%} probability (Bayesian), the range extensions exceed the observed range if the range is established on less than six finds; if only two finds are used, such range extensions are an order of magnitude longer than the observed range. Evidently the standard biostratigraphic practice that identifies zonal boundaries as horizons rather than confidence intervals may not be justified at the resolution of typical fossiliferous sections.},

@article{Freyman2019,
abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to identify key evolutionary transitions that correspond with shifts in speciation and extinction rates. Stochastic character mapping has become the primary method used to infer the timing, nature, and number of character state transitions along the branches of a phylogeny. The method is widely employed for standard substitution models of characterevolution. However, current approaches cannot be used for models that specifically test the association of character state transitions with shifts in diversification rates such as state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models. Herein, we introduce a new stochastic character mapping algorithm that overcomes these limitations, and apply it to study mating system evolution over a time-calibrated phylogeny of the plant family Onagraceae. Utilizing a hidden state SSE model we tested the association of the loss of self-incompatibility (SI) with shifts in diversification rates. We found that self-compatible lineages have higher extinction rates and lower net-diversification rates compared with self-incompatible lineages. Furthermore, these results provide empirical evidence for the "senescing" diversification rates predicted in highly selfing lineages: our mapped character histories show that the loss of SI is followed by a short-term spike in speciation rates, which declines after a time lag of several million years resulting in negative net-diversification. Lineages that have long been self-compatible, such as Fuchsia and Clarkia, are in a previously unrecognized and ongoing evolutionary decline. Our results demonstrate that stochastic character mapping of SSE models is a powerful tool for examining the timing and nature of both character state transitions and shifts in diversification rates over the phylogeny.},

@article{Fedorov2013,
abstract = {About five to four million years ago, in the early Pliocene epoch, Earth had a warm, temperate climate. The gradual cooling that followed led to the establishment of modern temperature patterns, possibly in response to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration, of the order of 100 parts per million, towards preindustrial values. Here we synthesize the available geochemical proxy records of sea surface temperature and show that, compared with that of today, the early Pliocene climate had substantially lower meridional and zonal temperature gradients but similar maximum ocean temperatures. Using an Earth system model, we show that none of the mechanisms currently proposed to explain Pliocene warmth can simultaneously reproduce all three crucial features. We suggest that a combination of several dynamical feedbacks underestimated in the models at present, such as those related to ocean mixing and cloud albedo, may have been responsible for these climate conditions.},
